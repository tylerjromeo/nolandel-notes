Zaar sits with his legs crossed on the ground, and holds out a hand to each side. "Everyone who wants to see will need to join in the circle.

He closes his eyes and begins chanting in a language you don't understand. He rocks back and forth and you feel an energy traveling up your hands and into your body. Zaar's eyes suddenly burst open, and they are solid black. But you don't see his eyes. You see out of his eyes. You see the <number> of you sitting on the floor in a circle. Black eyes all wide open.

You see Zaar dressed in hempen pants and no shirt sharpening an axe in the middle of a barbarian camp. A larger orc and a muscley dwarf approach Zaar. The orc grabs his axe while the dwarf laughs, and Zaar watches them walk away.

You see Zaar looting a body in the aftermath of a battle. He removes an amulet from the pocket of a bleeding man. The amulet is heavy in his hands, pure lead, and depicts a goat's head. The man reaches up and grabs Zaar's arm. The two lock eyes. You feel in Zaar's memory that the man's name is Marwen.

You see Marwen standing in front of a dead tree. He cuts his palm and draws a symbol on its trunk. The tree bursts into flames for only a second, and then is a pile of ash. A small, thin devil-creature emerges from the ash. Zaar watches his master intently.

You see Marwen asleep in a tent on a hot day. The air is thick and humid and thunder is rumbling although there is no rain of yet. Zaar has finished inscribing the secret symbols around the tent. He approaches Marwen and pluges a dagger precisely under his ribs, piercing the heart. He holds Marwen up, draining his heart's blood into a goblet. Marwen and Zaar lock eyes for the last time as the blood dribbles down Zaar's chin.

You feel Zaar's connection to the Infernal flame. Its so strong, so complete. Zaar has taken Marwen's power and Marwen's knowledge. There is an overwhelming hatred boiling up in Zaar. Hammerfast must be destroyed. Marwen had wanted to, and now Zaar could. He had to, or this hatred would be all-consuming.

Zaar is in battle, not weak as he once was. A destructive force, his flames consume all comers. The leader of Zaar's new orc tribe yells in triumph, as the two of them press forward, leaving destruction in their wake.

Zaar is in hammerfast. The feeling of hatred and the supernatural wards against orcs make his head throb with pain. THe city is dying from a decaying wound, but it's not dying fast enough. He is standing over a weeping Mayor Hanotar, magically rewriting his own features to match the Mayors. Hanotar must stay alive to keep up appearances, but he will stay in the manse. If he tells anyone Zaar was here, he dies.

Zaar is in Moradin's Wood. He follow's Marwens instincts to its very center. He cuts his hand with a jagged knife draws a symbol on the largest tree in blood. The tree creaks in pain and loses color. It's life essence draining into the phylactery in Zaar's hand.

You see Zaar following Orelle into the catacombs, tricked by the promise of a reward from a mayor in disguise. Zaar is holding an orb, swirling orange and purple. Orelle, a few steps ahead, doesn't turn around in time. Zaar summons a whip of flaming thorns from his hands and skillfully wraps it around Orelle's ankle, binding him. Zaar grabs the orb from both sides and pulls, straining from the effort. The orb separates into a purple orb and an orange one. The Ayus and the Abhava. He shoots the Abhava into the center of the room. Zaar begins to cackle maniacally holding the Ayus. He uses it to conjure a wall of flesh, trapping Orelle with the Abhava beneath the city.

You see Zaar on the ground, held fast by 4 huge orcs, betrayed. Above him stands the leader of his tribe. Holding the Ayus. He brings it close to his face and inhales deeply. The leader grows taller and hus muscles bulge, and he laughs. He laughs and laughs and laughs and never stops, as the vision fades.
