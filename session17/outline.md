Intro: Drang kills the kid

# show up with Zaar at Ol' Sammy's
JoJo is confused
Zaar just wants to be let go. He'll betray what he knows about the Ayus and Abhava and what he did.
Used mayor disguise to hire Orelle with a stupid promise of wealth.
As Zaar, got orella to guide him under the tower, and left him in there with the Abhava, taking the Ayus away.
Returned to shining skull with the AYus, but sturm stole it from him.
Having lost his position with shinign skull, Zaar locked the mayor in his house and took his identity.

Mayor is still alive in his house.
He got the ayabhava by draining the essense of the forest.
He learned about the forest from his mentor, Marwen.
He did this thing because he wants to join Marwen as a Lord of Hell.

# Arlene
She has gone to the Mayor's manse and is breaking down the defenses to try to kill the mayor.
Hell magic has warded the whole house from the inside and the outside.
Assassin demon is inside as well.
3 way fight where Arlene is trying to kill mayor, and demon is trying to kill party?
Basement trapdoor?
