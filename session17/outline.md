Intro: Drang kills the kid

Drang you're standing above the boy you've just met. His eyes are searching for you, unable to focus. You father, Sturm, walks up and stands next to you. His broad shoulders block out the setting sun as you look up at him. He quickly surveys and understands the situation. Sturm draws a sword and offers it, hilt first, to you Drang.

"Help your father out"
"Finish him off"
"If you're too weak to do it, I'll have to do it for you..."
"Three. Two. One..."

"Look at this cut! Well done, son of Sturm"
"We'll make a warrior out of you yet"

# show up with Zaar at Ol' Sammy's
JoJo is confused
Zaar just wants to be let go. He'll betray what he knows about the Ayus and Abhava and what he did.
He will try to escape with a hell druid power, and be foiled.
Do a "mind link" thing and get the Zaar flashback.
Used mayor disguise to hire Orelle with a stupid promise of wealth.
As Zaar, got orella to guide him under the tower, and left him in there with the Abhava, taking the Ayus away.
Returned to shining skull with the AYus, but sturm stole it from him.
Having lost his position with shinign skull, Zaar locked the mayor in his house and took his identity.

Mayor is still alive in his house.
He got the ayabhava by draining the essense of the forest.
He learned about the forest from his mentor, Marwen.
He did this thing because he wants to join Marwen as a Lord of Hell.

# Arlene
She has gone to the Mayor's manse and is breaking down the defenses to try to kill the mayor.
Hell magic has warded the whole house from the inside and the outside.
Assassin demon is inside as well.
3 way fight where Arlene is trying to kill mayor, and demon is trying to kill party?
Basement trapdoor?
if they go to her house, oldest son (Artemis) answers the door. Will trust henry's intentions and tell them she went to the Mayor's manse for a stakeout.
She hasn't heard about the party, has just been waiting for him to leave or be alone.
Maybe sees the party breaking in, maybe they see her skulking.
