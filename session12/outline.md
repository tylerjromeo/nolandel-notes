## Walk on the beach

You're walking down the banks of the river Roor back towards Roorsven. Morelian wants to pick up his equipment from the barn before you all head back to BLADE HQ. The air is thick with humidity from the long storm that just ended. Toorshuul, Morelian, and a mix of Cronn's pirates and Roorsven sailors walk in mixed groups, combining and splitting as conversations start and end. On the river, Bodhi has fashioned some stnading paddleboards from driftwood, he and the beach dwarves are riding them downstream, attempting to push each other into the river.

The 4 of you find yourselves walking in the same group. Bandor you remember the vision you had when the storm was banished and the voice: "You could have been so powerful"

## Blade

As soon as you emerge from the teleportation room, you are overwhelmed by the sound of applause. The full membership of BLADE is gathered waiting for you to arrive. dozens of people, some of whom you have met, some you haven't are pushing on you from all sides, shaking your hands, clapping your back, and cheering your success. After what feels like hours, you see Lamruil, the leader of BLADE, standing on a raised platform with his hands raised. "Everyone here knows that the fight against the dark elements is arduous. Victories like this are rare, and so we must celebrate this team for their hard work! Bandor, Duur-Ima, Morelian, Drang, Henry, and Torshuul! Let us take the night then, to take joy in this victory" Lamruil claps his hands above his head, concentrates for a moment, and brings them apart and downward, conjuring tables and tables of food and drink. The crod cheers as the party begins.

## Tracking

"Here's what my folks on the ground are saying. The Empire has left a small force in Roorsven, but not much. They have a lot of their bureaucrats and artificers heading west to the Imperial Weapons research outpost. Their military is heading south. Kourian Graves, that guy who tried to arrest us in Orreton, has started a "Public Safety Initiative" that is rooting out anti-Imperials. They are planning to move south slowly towards Emmnor, making many stops on the way. Not sure why Emmnor is their destination, but it may become difficult for you to travel Where PSI has recently been active. We'll keep an eye on their location."

## Birdman rescue

While you're looking at Halvael's stock, you hear a strange sound outside. A high pitched and very loud trill. It fills your ears almost to the point where it's painful. After a few seconds the sounds stops. A voice rings out inside the shop "Halvael, have you got anyone over there right now?"

"I do Lamruil, the new celebrities are here"

"Good, have them go check out that alarm. A portal we weren't expecting opened up briefly somewhere downwind from you. Give them some gliders and send them out."

The gliders seem like nothing more than large kits at first, but when you pick one up you see that they are attuned witht he air of this plane. Your touch commands the air around the gliders wings and allows you to fly.

While holding a glider in the plane of air, you can use your standard action to fly up to 60 feet.

As you fly, you see a lot of empty space and rolling clouds, every now and then you see small floating islands. Eventually, you see a gray/green light shining from one particular group of islands. Getting closer you see that there are Aarakocra standing on those islands, investigating the light, which is shining from a Wood Elf woman you have not met before.

Zulf is the leader. Very proud. Believes he owns the sky and everything in it. "The teleporting elf is ours"
