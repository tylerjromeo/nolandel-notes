## Birdman rescue

While you're looking at Halvael's stock, you hear a strange sound outside. A high pitched and very loud trill. It fills your ears almost to the point where it's painful. After a few seconds the sounds stops. A voice rings out inside the shop "Halvael, have you got anyone over there right now?"

"I do Lamruil, the new celebrities are here"

"Good, have them go check out that alarm. A portal we weren't expecting opened up briefly somewhere downwind from you. Give them some gliders and send them out."

The gliders seem like nothing more than large kits at first, but when you pick one up you see that they are attuned witht he air of this plane. Your touch commands the air around the gliders wings and allows you to fly.

While holding a glider in the plane of air, you can use your standard action to fly up to 60 feet.

As you fly, you see a lot of empty space and rolling clouds, every now and then you see small floating islands. Eventually, you see a gray/green light shining from one particular group of islands. Getting closer you see that there are Aarakocra standing on those islands, investigating the light, which is shining from a Wood Elf woman you have not met before.

Zulf is the leader. Very proad. Believes he owns the sky and everything in it. "The teleporting elf is ours"
