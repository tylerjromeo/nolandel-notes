# Heist planning

argue about splitting the take?

* Getting in. Magic memory guy. Steelkin entrance

* Getting up.
 - spiral stair ascent, but have to cross sometimes.

 The floor plan/stairs can shift hogwarts style(so I can calibrate how many encounters to do)
 - "organic weaponry division" Monster stable
- "advanced training facility" enhanced humans (vivsected warforged?)
- "extraplanar medical treatment facility" Necromancy stuff
- "automated production" Conveyor belt puzzle

Arcane *disruptor* make an arcana check to un-load a smoke weapon?

# prep mission

materials for lightening spell? Arcane disruptor?

Mini dungeon crawl in the Clockwork Wilds of the Steel quarter (clockwork enemies, traps)

Clockwork wilds are a bizzare area, where entropy is reverse and order wins out over chaos. The result is wild creatures made of gears and machinery (think Neir Automata) Look at clockwork section in M's Tome of Monsters

centrally controlled clockwork area (like a zelda) They have to traverse one way, then change something, then traverse back

Grease everywhere as a hazard

CLOCKTOPUS?
