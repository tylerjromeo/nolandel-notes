# Ebonshard mine


Orin Cragjaw
A dwarf with skin the color of red clay, the top of his head is bald, but the sides of his head and face are covered in long, dark black hair. He is wearing a mining harness and holding an enourmous pickaxe

As he speaks, he gestures with the pickaxe as if it weights nothing.

## Intro

Ride in a minecart

As you descend the air gets colder

Earthy wet smell

The squel of the mine cart's wheels straining against the track echo through the tunnels.

"We found a new section of mine over in the east tunnel that broke into some kind of catacombs. A crew of 4 went in to explore, and never came back. Nor did the 2 we sent after them 3 days later, or the 3 we sent 2 days after that. Over  a thousand years of mining experience is lost in that passage. It's not a cave in, underground gas, or an accident. My miners are too good for that. There's something down there that's different. That's why we brought you in."

As the mine cart stops, Orin points out a narrow passage in the cave wall, only a few feet wide 

"That's where we broke into a new section. The boys said it was worked stone in there, like catacombs. Get my miners back. Find out what is in there, and make sure it doesn't come out and do anything to my mine. Here, I can hear this whistle from anywhere in the mine. Blow it near a car track and I'll come get you."


## in catacombs

As you move through the passage, the scent of cold stone gives way to something eathier and more alive. You emerge into a hallway with cracked, even walls and 90 degree corners. The floor is made from cobbled stone with many broken pieces.

## kobolds:

"If we brings the treasure to she then she not hurting us."

"you puts it with ours behind the special wall or we tells her and she hurting only you"

"is mine coins. I finding them"

## Story 1

You see 4 stout, small forms on the ground. Their bodies are covered in dark gray Grave Beetles. You can't make out any of their features... But they are the shape of dwarves.

Suddenly, the two bodies in the corner start to stir. They move with unnaturally slow and jerky motions

## Story 2
You smell death in this room before you can see anything. There are 3 bodies on the ground, a man, a dwarf, and a halfling. The man and the dwarf have their heads removed. The halfling is laying on the ground with a noose tied around his neck. There are a few grave beetles on each body, but not many.

## Story 3

Boyland Fletcherson. A young human man with a thin build and shoulder length, dirty blonde hair. His eyes are puffy and red and his clothes are torn and dirty. "YOU STAY AWAY" he yells, brandishing a notched shortsword.

In the corner are 2 bodies, dismembered and covered in Grave beetles. They each have a small piece of torn cloth covering their faces.

"Saya and Aeviel went into that room... they ran out after a little bit and chained up the door. Both fo them were hurt. We came back here to try to recover but just last night they started to... Change... and I...."

## Boss Monster

The room appear empty except for 2 large pillers near the center. Your footsteps echo in the large chamber...

Suddenly, from the back of the room, there is a loud rumbling sound. The back wall bursts open and a creature emerges from the depths. <show picture>

A long skeletal beast with many legs and an insect-like head. Instead of flesh, the surface of the bone is covered in millions of grave beetles

They are impress with how the party was able to defeat the elemental, however the Grand Abjuration couldn't be performed.

"This wasn't supposed to happen here, and we were lucky you were here... We should talk more."

"Look, there's an inn down the road from here, the Dancing Shrew. Meet me there, we'll eat and I'll explain some things. Then maybe you four can explain some things to me..."
