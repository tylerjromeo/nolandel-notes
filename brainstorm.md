## Themes

evil empire is not responsible for the Big Bad, but they aren't helping either

membership in a secret organization

a threat known only to the players and their friends

"mission" based arcs

character highlight arcs

Calamity

Emperor is a well meaning but out of touch Elon Musk genius type (human)

War is manipulated by a profiteering bad guy.

Ushad was going to win simply by waiting for Esmer to die. Profiteer provided the means to take Nolendel

What is waking the elementals? Esmer's use of them in weapons

### Characters

Esmer - charismatic, likeable, intelligent. Magnanimous to the people around him. His policies cause a lot of indirect harm which he willfully ignores. Human

Profiteering bad guy is pretty much Zorg from the 5th element. The Avatar of Calamity is communicating with him.

### vague ideas

It would be cool to have a notice board in towns

Repres

Live through a character's "memories" of how they became "attuned" w/ the dark elements

Some folks have artifacts that spread the elements. Given by the profiteering bad guy.

Maybe they meet the profiteer as an npc shopkeep type at first??

Heist mission to steal something smoke related from the Emperor

Lamruil is an Ushad Royal

Lockdown in Orreton.

Need to rescue *contact* from Empire

They should gain powers when absorbing the dark elementals
