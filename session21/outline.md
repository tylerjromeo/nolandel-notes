# Intro

Duur-Ima you are sitting on a bench in a large barnhouse. There are 40 or 50 people here, more than you've seen in many years. On the stage there is a string band, playing a jaunty folk song. Many of the villagers are dancing in the center of the barn. Others are standing around talking, or eating. Nalen is in the far corner of the room with 3 other people, standing around a large pot of stew. She is slicing some vegetables and smiling uncomfortably at the others.

The village is called Holbrook, and the villagers have welcomed you with hospitality and kindness.

As you sit, a small child comes up to you and taps you on the leg "Hi! I'm Annabelle"

"Come dance with me! Don't you know how to dance?"

# Emmnor

You're sitting at Itham's place. You've found it to be very comfortable. It's been a while since he left, the sun is setting and you see some birds diving at each other in the distance.

# Plant talk

The Moss

The Grass - Rats make their nests in the grass

Kaopa trees: Their bark is "ripened" by Jietzi Flies. But the flies are gone

Yarrels - Omnivorous, must mostly eat Kaopa Bark and Lokoro birds. Getting more aggressive as they can't find ripe bark

Jietzi Flies - getting eaten by rats (actually imps)

Lokoro birds - pretty much yellow/green cockatoos

Dark ones (shadow imps) they have been driven into the forest by the piety of Lathander's followers. They have rat, spider, and raven forms



# Eirina

Ellen Ripley type.

Treat Duur-Ima like she's not related.

She had to make a bargain with Shar to conceive. They didn't think the loss would be so hard. Itham is in denial, Eirina knows Duur-Ima won't return.

She's the only one in Emmnor that sees Hesterston as a threat. She has approached them asking them to leave. But they won't.

She met with Judge Parris when they first arrived and agreed on borders, but they have been moving closer.

"I don't care where they go, but they have no right to be here, killing our forest."


# Hesterston

See blighted fields (4) that are warded by holy power.

Because the blight killed their crops, they were forced to ward the area and plant anew.

The blighted areas will be healed by Lathander through devotion, none but those santified in the dawn can enter.

4 shrines/stations to clear to lower barriers

"From death, life."
"There is always another dawn"
"In the dawn, beuty reigns, and the way is clearer"
"By dawn's light shall we all be saved"
"Those touched by the light of dawn can do no evil"
"Fear the Shadow, hidden from His light"

PSI has contacted them, and is on the way for "support"

Hear their horn near the end of the session
