* Met Eirina Mol. She was cold towards Duur-Ima, and keeping a watch on the nearby community of Hesterston
* Enjoyed a fine Nabyssian Red Wind with Itham Mol> Duur-Ima promised she woudl return to help him build a platform in his tree one day
* Kiri got a letter from Haeval with a list of supplies needed to make shapeshifting armor
* The next morning, headed towards Hesterston to see the situation
* Waylaid by Starving Yarrels on the way, had to fight through.
* Ravens came in the aftermath of the battle, Duur-Ima snatched one and it turned into an imp
* Bribed the imp with marshmallows and he revealed he used to live in the fields to the east
* Headed into Hesterston through a field of grain. Saw that one of the fields appeared to be dying and was covered by a shimmering transluscent gold dome...
