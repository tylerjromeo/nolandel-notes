You go to the Garrison with JoJo, and see there is a flurry of activity. Soldiers are moving everywhere, preparing for the operation. You quickly find the command building and see Crag poring over a map with a figure clad in full plate mail.

As you approach, the armored figure raises his visor and you see his white hair and the crinkled corners of his eyes. He shakes each of your hands in turn with a strong grip and says, grinning. "Well met, I'm Hartman Selmy. You must be the folks who gave Edgeworth that bag of rice"

Crag says "Commander Selmy and I were just going through what we know. Let me talk you through it"

Considerations:
* We don't know exactly where they are. We could wander into bad terrain, or be attacked while searching
* They might come for the wall if they know about it
* We should have the numbers advantage on them
* There's a war on, if we lost too much here adn Ushad attacks soon, the city might be lost.
* What is the group's agenda

JoJo:
* If this is important to stopping decay, can get a couple guys with gliders to help. (maybe they tilt the scales towards ushad?)
