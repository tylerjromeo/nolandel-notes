When a duel is over, the winner is the stronger warrior, and therefore is right in the disagreement.

It is dishonorable to be caught cheating in a duel. However it is MORE dishonorable to lose a duel, so cheating happans.

It is also dishonorable to accuse your foe of cheating, because the strong can win against all odds.

Duels are strictly 1 on 1, but the most common form of cheating is to have your friends interfere with the duel. This sometimes results in minor skirmishes between the folks trying to help their friends duel

Only if the cheating is blatant and visible to all watching the duel will it ever be acknowledged.

Duels are not often to the death. It's considered tacky to kill a defeated foe in a duel (although it does happen)

If the duel is over property, someone nearby holds it during the duel and gives all stakes to the winner at the end. UNLESS the duel is over a weapon, in which case it can be used during the duel.
