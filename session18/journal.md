This session we:
* Made a plan to sneak into the Shining Skull camp and assassinate Sturm
* Got JoJo to get a crew of glider operators from B.L.A.D.E. to come help
* Joe Pesci and his halfling crew flew overhead and found the camp.
* Snuck up and found the path weel guarded. Quickly and quietly eliminate the guard to get into the heart of the camp
* Deeper in the camp, tried to sneak up to sturms tent, but were found out and the camp was alerted.
* Sturm joined the fight with the Ayus, and challenged Drang to a ritual duel for his sword. Drang resfused, and signalled Joe Pesci.
* Joe Pesci and his crew dropped rocks on the orc camp from above, removing everyone but Sturm from the fight.
* Sturm fought hard, drawing on the power of the Ayus but was defeated.
* Drang spared Sturm and allowed him to leave
* Drang ordered Shining Skull to help rebuild Hammerfast instead of attacking, and to renounce their marauding ways.
* The group reunited the Ayus and the Abhava and returned the energy to Moradin's Wood.
* Returning the Ayabhava allowed the forest to expell decay, forcing it to coalesce and allowing the party to perform the banishing ritual.
* Kiri cast a long Plant growth spell in the forest to restore it to what it was before.
* Decay arc finished!
* Level up to 6!
