# Nolandel

The nation of Nolandel sits between the warring Esmerian Empire and the Republic of Ushad. The Esmerians and the Ushadi have been at war for nearly a century, with neither side able to gain the upper hand over the other. That is until Nolander was conquered 6 years ago by the forces of Emperor Jarrus Esmar.

In the years since the conquest, life has gradually but steadily changed for Nolenderians. Some towns have readily accepted Imperial rule, others quietly plan rebellion and insurrection. Some remote villages are only barely aware of the Empire, because they don't have energy to spare for anything other than the harvest and their families.

The Empire new position in Nolandel should have been a huge strategic advantage, but the war remains at a standstill. Esmerian and Ushadi forces alike are beset by strage occurances. Natural disasters, disease, and accidents are happening more and more frequently. As if the land itself is resisting the war...

## Demographics:
Any and all races in the cities/trade hubs. Lots of Elves/gnomes near the Ushad border. Lots of Dwarves/dragonborn in the Mountains. Humans everywhere. Halflings everywhere. Generally diverse

Volo's races rare. Maybe they will be around in future...


## Govniu

Govniu - God of the Forge and the Hearth
Domains: Forge, Knowledge, Life
Symbols: A hammer resting on a loaf of bread; a roaring fireplace with an anvil inset amongst the flames.
Govniu is master of the forge. He is also keeper of the rules of hospitality. He prepares the great feasts of the gods. He is associated with great craftsmanship and with prosperity. Many people say a prayer to Govniu before meals in hopes that their future meals will always have a full table surrounded by many friends. Travelers sometimes pray to Govniu to lead them to a house where they will receive proper hospitality. 
Blacksmiths and other artisans often pray to Govniu to guide their hands so that they can produce excellent works. When a particularly masterful object is created, the person is said to have been possessed by Govniu during their work - a mark of a true artisan.
There is a winter holiday called Gwledduia (which means Feast of the Gods) on which it is believed the gods gather together for a great feast hosted by Govniu in his own home. To celebrate, people have big feasts in their own homes, inviting over as many as they can. Anyone, even a stranger, who comes to a house that is feasting on Gwledduia must be welcomed in and allowed to join in the celebrations, just as Govniu would do.
A temple to Govniu always has a room with a hearth and a table where meals can be prepared and served to travelers or the poor. Serving a meal in a temple to Govniu is considered an act of worship.
(Inspired by the Irish god, Goibniu.)
