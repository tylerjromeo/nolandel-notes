# flashback

Henry in prison, gets "blackballed" by thieve's guild. Has a terrible time

# morelian and Yaldobath

explain how the base has become an "anchor" for smoke power.

Need to cut off the tower from it's source of power in order to decouple it. Otherwise it will explode with energy when the catalyst is removed

yaldobath will make kiri's armor

Eirinia is skeptical of the plan

# The crew

Whetstone, leader.
Icy and Dicey, twin halfling rogues. 
Beartrap, Dwarven Guild Metalworker and former Imperial employee. 
Razor the Steelkin.
Sparks, halfling wizard. 
Piper, the human Captain of Glenham's guard,

Piper can escort the infiltration team directly to the source as a "repair team" (sabotage organized by Razor, designed by Beartrap)

The mechanism isn't draining excess smoke properly, it's filling the work area unless it's vented continuously

icy and dicey will pilot false steelkin bodies and come with.

Plan is to get on top, Icey and Dicey will seal the doors, Smokey and team will use Spark's featherweight scroll on the platinum catalyst. The team will take it to the roof and push it off to the north, where whetstone will recover it

# the betrayal
The scroll is actually teleportation magic. The tower will explode and be flooded with smoke when the catalyst is removed

# The heist

Henry is late and the party is pressured near the door

Harold gets them in (easy)

Flavor for climb

We'll want a sneak/combat where they use the disruptor against guards armed with smoke weapons


There should be a fight with security or elemental forces at the top level. (have states for harold, icy, and dicey as well)

# Aftermath

after henry absorbs smoke. Their bodies are all pulled into the plane of ruin. Whimsy prevents their bodies from being taken, as their boon from Yiva the Dragon Keeper is fulfilled, but their souls are taken. Endgame begins.

# icey/dicey

# harold

# Smoke monster
