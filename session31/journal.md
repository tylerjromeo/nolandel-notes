Last session we:

* Henry gave the arcane core to The thieve's guid crew.
* The crew revealed the plan: Razor will sabotage one of the systems, and Piper will escort in a repair crew by night: himself, Icey and Dicey in disguice, and the party.
* Met with Morelian and Yaldobath. Morelian revealed that the Blade HQ is being used as an anchor for the smoke energy.
* Yaldobath made druid armor for Kiri
* Bandor bluffed his way out of a sticky situation with guards using Charm Person and his musician fame.
* Got in and convinced Piper to hang with the party while we explored the corridors going up to the upper floor
* Had some close calls with guards, but killed them all without detection.
* Henry stabbed Piper, who was someone from his past. Duur-Ima read his thoughts during the confrontation.
* The party headed up to the top floor of the research tower.
