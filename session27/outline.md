# Inn scene

They find an Inn, but JoJo doesn't want to go in
# Machine city approach

After a long journey, you finally see your destination on the Horizon. The Machine City of Glenham. The steel-worked walls loom, streatching far in both directions and you can see the skyline shifting as the mechanisms in teh tall buildings move. And above the city in the sky, you see several dark plumes forming in the air, making a funnel of smoke from the sky into the city.

In the Plane of Air, you see Torshuul and Morelian standing guard in front of the teleportation rooms, waiting for an attack that hasn't yet come. Morelian is in the middle of a long story about the history of silk hats when Torshull raises one finger. There's a light hissing coming from one of the rooms. He draws a polearm and starts to approach, when the building collapses with a load crash. Thick black smoke begins to sprtead from the wreckage. Morelian whistle for help and starting trying to ward the area, but it's no help. The air is flooded and all are coughing and choking.

Morelian quickly grabs a scroll from his pack and reads it, and a shrill 3-toned alarm sounds. Just as planned, the members of blade emerge and begin to evauate, as the castle is overtaken by smoke.
