# Temple of Govniu

Boyland's strength gives out on the walk to the village.

Cleric - Davner Brushmender

invites them in, very welcoming.

Drang is fine. Davner gives him what is essentially an aspirin.

Boyland is not in great shape. He'll need to stay. Someone will need to pay for the materials (15g) for healing magic and to keep him there for 2 weeks. (negotiable)

"This is not a normal infection... It's not responding the way I would expect."

"If you could find out more about it, that might help"

# Dinner with JoJo

How did you know that beast was in the mine?

How were you hurting it like that?

Do you not know what that was?

Okay... You need to meet Morelion.

That thing you fought was a Dark Elemental. It's the biggest one I've ever seen. The organization I work for, B.L.A.D.E., tracks down those things and stops them from hurting people or destroying towns. We haven't failed in decades. Until that creature killed 8 people in the mine"

# Next day

JoJo answers the door and gestures fo you all to come in.

"close and lock the door behind you. It doesn't work if a door is open."

JoJo takes out a long wooden wand. Starting at the floor, she traces the shape of a door on the wall in front of her, then presses her palm firmly on the center of the rectangle. The wall swings away, revealing a room on the other side.

"You big folks may have to duck. Follow me."

# B.L.A.D.E. HQ

The door shuts behind you, and you're in a small, stone chamber. Ahead of you, JoJo is already fussing with the latch on another door. As she pulls it open, bright sunlight streams into the room. Outside, you see a field of grass that gives way to a bright blue sky with fog covering the horizon. To the left is a large stone castle

Outside you can see that the horizon isn't foggy at all, it's clouds. The castle and courtyard are floating, suspended in the sky. The warm breeze pushes on the blades of grass beneath your feet.

There are a dozen or so people milling around, performing various tasks. All of them are displaying the same patch on their clothing.


# Morelian's Arcanium

Morelian's lab is a cluttered mess of artifacts and magical knick knacks. Chief among them is the large, swinging pendulum in the middle of the room. Over 20 feet long, the pendulums swings in wide circles. As it passes over the floor, it traces patterns on the map of Nolandel beneath it. Morelian is fiddling with a magical apparatus on the ground, causing different parts of the map to highlight.

Morelin himself is a brod shouldered, blond half-elf wearing half moon glasses and a colorful doublet. A small red dragon with indistinct borders dozes on his shoulder. "JoJo what happened down there? There was a huge spike of Decay. I was about to ask someone to go try to find you"

## Morelian's monologue

There are 4 major elemental planes that intersect with our material plane. Fire, water, earth, and air. The plane of air, incidentally, is where we are right now. The principal component parts of the material plane come from these 4 elements. However, there's more to the world than just 4 things.

Subservient to the 4 elements, are what we've taken to calling the Dark Elements. Decay, Smoke, Blight, and Storm. These dark elements are important for how life functions. Decay fertilizes the soil, smoke purifies and cleanses, blight prevents growth from covering the land, and storm moves things great distances. These Dark Elements must exist in a balance with the major elements for life to exist.

Several centuries ago, something happened. We don't know what it was, but the balance of elements began to shift to the Dark. Thousands died of plague, hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters, and it was getting worse. A consortium of wizards and sorcerors assembled to correct the imbalance with arcane magic. They built a magical dam of sorts against the Dark Elements. Part of the magic erased the very memory of the Dark Elementals from the general populace as a safeguard against those who would summon them. One of those sorcerors, Lamruil, went on to found B.L.A.D.E. The Society for Binding, Location, and Abjuration of Dark Elementals.

(q&a)

Listen, I have a lot more questions to ask, but I think it might be better if we just do a test.

# Courtyard fight

## Round 1

Ice mephit

Page 215

## Round 2

2X Smoke Mephit

Page 217

As you defeat the Smoke Mephit, a plume of smoke rises up into the sky, and the air begins to crakle around you. Suddenly the clouds above you turn black, and the remaining mephit starts to glow, and grow in size.

The Smoke mephit bursts, and where 1 elemental imp stood, there are now 4.

Dark energy swirls all around you as more and more Mephits burst into existence. Toorshul, JoJo, and Morelian are all engaged with their own elemental imps, as well as the other guards and B.L.A.D.E. members

Decay mephit (dust mephit stats)
Smoke mephit 
Storm mephit (steam mephit stats)
Blight mephit (magma mephit stats, but with blight flavor)

## After fight

Lamruil Banishes the remaining Mephits.

As the last of your Mephits dissapates, you see the battle around you proceeding. Some are doing better than others, but no one has dispatched their foes as quickly as you have. Just then, a figure emerges from the arcanium. A tall elf in fine robes with long, gray hair. He quickly swings his staff in a wide circle, and you see electricity in his eyes. Arcane energy emerges from the elf in an expanding circle. It passes harmlessly over your bodies, but when it hits a Mephit, they dissa;ate immediately. The chaos of battle ends abruptly as the magical field is lowered. "Could you quiet down out here?"

Morelian rushes towards the figure tripping over his own feet a little bit, "Lamruil, I... I have no idea why that happened." He looks over at his arcane instruments, and then at you barely supressing a grin. "There's something about these people... I'll need to look at the data and what conclusions I can draw"

# Parting gear

1x BLADE teleportation wand. Once per day allows you to draw a door on the inside wall of a closed room. This door will transport you to BLADE headquarters on the elemental plane of air. When you go back through the door, you will return to the same room that you left. If the room where the door was conjured is opened, you reappear in the room immediately, fall prone, and take 1d10 psychic damage.
1x message box. A box about 8" x 4" x 4" with a hinged lid and a latch. This box is part of a matched pair, of which B.L.A.D.E. has the other half. Anything put into the box can be retrieed from either box. Only 1 of the boxes can be open at a time. The box will not open if it's matched partner is alread open. This is used to send letters to/from B.L.A.D.E.


# Back in Town

The Empire has showed up. They have closed the mine.

Plan on doing research on the arcane energy. "You won't even need this mine! The arcane powers are going to make you all rich! Don't you understand that?"

See Guard Captian (recurring character)

Kourian Graves. Ambitious, ruthless, loyal, capable.

A grizzled, very tall middle aged man. He is dressed in full plate mail, but without his helmet on. He carries an enormous sword across his back

Either just leave, or fight 4x guards plus the captian. Captian has a smoke weapon and can do a blade warp
