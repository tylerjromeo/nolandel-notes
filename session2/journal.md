Last session we:

* Brought Boyland to Davner to cleric of Govniu in Orreton
* Served a meal and purchased supplies for the Temple of Govniu (-15g) in exchange for them keeping Boyland for 2 weeks.
* Traveled to B.L.A.D.E. HQ in the Elemental plane of Air with JoJo
* Met Morelian, the Dark Elemental Researcher
* Learned of the 4 Dark Elements: Decay, Blight, Smoke, and Storm. Which B.L.A.D.E. has been fighting, and are on the rise.
* Met Torshuul, the surly Dragonborn tuffboi from B.L.A.D.E.
* Particiapted in an experiment fighting Dark Elementals with Morelian. The experiment escalated; Lamruil, founder of B.L.A.D.E. had to intervene and banish all of the Mephits.

* Morelian asked you to mean with his contact in Nolendel. He will send you a letter with details.
* Got gear from B.L.A.D.E.: HQ Teleportation Portal wand, Two-way box, and a mundane weapon each (let me know what you end up picking)
* Got a promissary note for 500g if you manage to help Morelian discover the way to better fight Dark Elementals that you 4 are using.

* Upon returning to Orreton, there's a commotion downstairs. The sound of many people arguing...
