# Intro


You're sitting in the main hall of the Crossroads Inn. It's late, but there are still a few people around. All of you hear the telltale clink of chainmail and creaking wheels coming through a nearby window. The transport cart from The Hole is coming down the road and soon, they will turn down one of three roads.

The cart is make of heavy wood, reinforced with iron. It is pulled by 2 huge, muscular pack horses. In the drivers seat sit and armored man and woman. 2 guards march in front of the cart, 2 behind, and 2 on each side. The driver has a thin face, with sharp eyes, her companion has a packmarked face with heavy jowls and a bald head.

It's hard to see in the dark, but the air around the cart looks strange. Like the air above a campfire, it is wavy and indistinct. Like a layer of mirage.

Each of you give me an vague idea of what you have done this evening leading up until now.

The cart turns down the Southern path. Now you know where you can intercept them.

It starts to rain as you make your approach. The place you've chosen is a path through a particularly thick part of the woods. There are many trees, and the ground is covered in thick brush.

As you take your places, there is a flash of lightning, and you see the silhouette of the cart approaching for an instant before you hear a loud crack of thunder.

1 round free movement before initiative.

In the cart you see a figure lying in the corner. Arms bound and a hood over it's head. Also in the cart is a metal device, a cube 2 feet by 2 feet, compleetely covered in glowing runic markings.

Yaldobath's eyes open, and they glow with an icy blue light. Standing up, you see they're an androgynous human, very short though still taller than a dwarf. The blue light dances from their eyes, around their long hair and hands. Yaldobath flexes stretches as the magical energy gathers around.

# Storm elemental

Moving down the road, the storm seems to be getting worse and worse. The rain flies sideways into your face and hair. It's hard to talk aboce the sound of the wind. You can see again, as the sun as risen behind the dark clouds

Lightning strikes a nearby tree, and it starts to fall. The air is ful of the sound of branches cracking and then a loud slam as it hits the ground. And a wind starts to dance around the four of you, in your clothes and around your faces, constantly changing directions. In the road in front of you a stormcload forms into a body, huge and imposing. Two eyes of ball lightning look down on you menancingly, and it leans back and roars with the sound of rolling thunder. Initiative.

# Yaldobath dialog

"Seem to be back to normal. Scary thing, that anti magic field. Wonder where they got it. Hate it. Still interesting though. Who are you? Thank you for the rescue. I do wonder why though."

"Storming. Not a great place to stay, this. Anywhere we can go?"

"Morelian? Are you with Blade then? You don't have the look. The Blade folks take things to seriously. Can't change the elements. Why would you want to? Too interesting to watch I think. And I do think about it a lot."

"Data? Let's look"

Yaldobath is silent for a full 8 seconds, the longest break they have taken since they regained conciousness

"He's right. This all checks out. The subjects have an innate resonance. Unique. Can't imagine how it got there. Horrible difficult to reproduce. Poor fools. Interesting though. Each one has a subcategory, but the effect seems to be broad. There's some dampening here too, something held back. Ha ha, Morelian's never going to stop running tests on them."

Yaldobath produces a parchment and quill from thin air, and begins writing, talking non-stop. Eventually, they hand you the parchment.

"That'll tell Morelian what he needs to know. Tell him I say hi. I won't be visiting though, it gets harder to return every time I step into another plane."

"Still, can't go bath to Roorsven now that Esmer's got me marked. Need to find a new place to set up shop. Annoying. Perhaps north. Interesting energy to the north."

# Dark moon

When you return to the temple. You see there is only one robed figure inside. Standing still and facing the door, face hidden under their hood.

"You have returned, acolyte"

(high difficulty insight)

"The price Kargath promised for the device is now paid. May he find peace in this Loss"

"As you know, the price Shar demands for service is Loss. The Emperor has sent many to take Loss for him. But his desires grow. Soon, he will want to speak with Her personally. Then he will know true Loss."

"Thank you for passing through acolyte. May the Darkness keep you hidden and always in service"

# Blade headquarters

When you return, people are moving around very quickly. Dispite the late hour, there's a lot of activity and nervous energy. You see JoJo among those moving around, she's carrying a large scak of magic scrolls and yelling something at a group of elves.

"You're back! What did Yaldobath think? How are they doing?"

"Oh... I see. Well." Morelian looks at each of you. "Let get you paid and we'll... Talk"

You return to Morelian's lab. Behind him the element pendulum in swinging erratically.

"The power you have when fighting these Dark elementals. It's something innate to each of you that allows you to affect the Dark elemental planes. A projection of sorts that you each have onto that plane. Like how ghosts can touch other ghosts, you four can touch the essence of a dark elemental in a way no other material being can"

"The fact that the four of you just met, and immediately encounter a Prime Dark Elemental is wildly improbable and extremely suspicious. But it is a blessing that we found you."

"I think we need your help to fight these things, and I think it's time we offer you four membership in Blade."

The rod of the element pendulum suddenly snaps, and the weight falls to teh ground with a crash.

"There might not be time for that though... The storm elemental has awoken"

# Duur-Ima's dream

In your dream, you remember a nigh several months ago. A fire was burning outside of yours and Nalen's home. Several nearby villagers were gathered, sitting and listening to a story from Nalen. A faint smile plays across her (?) face as she gets to the good part. And then the dream stops moving. The flames of the campfire are frozen in the air; the villagers are frozen, one with his cup held up to his mouth mid-drink.

Outside of the circle, a robed and hooded figure stands in the darkness, tall and broad-shouldered. The figure steps forward, looks at you, looks at Nalen, then looks back to you. YOu see the crest of Dark moon on the front of the robe.

The figures slowly lowers their hood. His injuries are healed slightly, and he locks eyes with you. He sees you, through the dream. And he knows. He sees Nalen. And he knows.

You wake up. And you know. Kourian Graves is coming.
