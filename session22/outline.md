# Intro

# Hesterston

You see a man in gold and red robes. He has salt and pepper hair and sharp features. His robes are clean, but simple and he carries a mace in a loop on his plan brown belt. Beside him is a woman, shorter than he and around the same age. She wears a white covering over her hair and a plain, brown dress over working boots.

"Hello there, travellers. Welcome to Hesterston. I am Judge Parris and this is my wife, Millicent."

* Things aren't going well in the village, they had to seal off their largest grain field and are trying to plant enough for the winter.
* The fields were infested with little beasts but The Light of Lathander drove them away
* Eirina has warned them about planting, but what else are they to do?
* (If trusted) They are worried about Emmnor attacking, so they petitioned the Empire, who is sening someone

"From death, life."
"There is always another dawn"
"In the dawn, beuty reigns, and the way is clearer"
"By dawn's light shall we all be saved"
"Those touched by the light of dawn can do no evil"
"Fear the Shadow, hidden from His light"

# PSI approaching

You hear the trumpeting of a harn in the distance. On the horizon you see the movement of the small army you saw from the air yesterday.

lieutenant Thaxton, A barrel chested human in full plate mail. Through his lifted visor, you see thick black hair and small, rapidly moving eyes.

You do not see Kourian Graves among the men.

# THE CHOICE NEEDS TO BE MADE: ALLOW PSI TO HELP THE FOREST, OR GO SAVE NALEN. IF THEY SAVE NALEN, EMMNOR WILL BE BURNT

# flash sideways

You're sitting, legs crossed in your hermitage. Your eyes are closed and you can feel everything, but you have no control over your body. You feel your mouth open and speak "Hello Duur-Ima"

It's Nalens voice.

Your eyes open and you see Nalen's arms and body. Your muscles feel tight and your body feels older

"I wanted to say a quick goodbye. Shar has been sending us dreams... Maybe you're better than me at blocking Her voice... But I can feel it coming. The one who has been hunting Shar's followers. He's climbing the mountain now"

Nalen stands up and grabs a pair of wakizashi swords from under a floorboard

# Full moon?

* There is a man in Hesterston named Fenris Lycan. He's not the werewolf. His Cousin Richard Bellvue is.
* Richard has the transformation under control, so long as he is not attacked
