# Descriptions

The voyage on Cronn's ship "Kraken's Bane" is underway, nearly all the way upriver, but the journey is difficult. The wind and rain keep increasing. Cronn is at the helm of the ship with Morelian, consulting a map of the North sea. The crew is hurrying around working hard keeping the sails intact and looking very nervous, except of course, for Bodhi and his 3 beach Dwarves, who are singing while they work in defiance of the storm. Bodhi has used the word "gnarly" 13 times in the last 5 minutes.

As thunder crashes all around you, Torshuul descends from the crows next "Imperials behind us. They aren't gaining ground but if they survive the storm they'll get to us once we stop.

The storm gets worse and worse as you sail, the deck beneath you quakes as it passes over waves, moving up and down. Cronn does his best to keep the ship from capsizing; waves crash on top of the deck, soaking everyone on board. Suddenly Cronn yells an order, and most of the crew retreat below the decks, latching the hatches behind them to keep water out.

But then, the air grows still. You can see it raging all around, but here in the eye of the storm, things are calm for a moment. You see a blue shape floating in the air a few hundred feet away.

It's the sigil of storm.

The symbol reconfigures itself into a human shape, the same one you saw in the Smuggler's cave. He speaks, but only the 4 of you can understand.

"Stormwind, you have arrived. It is the time to strike and rage. Give the storm your blessing and we will consume the River's Town. With your leadership we will rule this land again"

# Transform

The energy seems to go out of the storm elemental and its falls, for the first time, on the deck of the ship. It lies still for a moment. It gets shakily to its feet and says, in a human's voice and the common tongue "No".

Then, in the storm's voice again, "NOOOOOOOO". The rain begins to swirl around and around. The sound of the wind is defeaning as the entire storm spirals into the elemental's body. The sky above you in clear and you feel the sun beating down, while a dark mass, pulsing with lightning, floats in front of you. It falls into the sea with a light *splash*.

The ship jolts to one side. There is a giant, crackling arm made of Storm reaching up from the sea. The burning, metal smell of ozone surrounds you as the hand slams down on the deck of the ship, and the reast of the creature emerges from the sea. The giant elemental bellows a series of crashes that carry a single, primal meaning: Rage. The ship lifts up from the ocean, and the creature brings the ship towards it's own face. 

# after banishment

Bandor, you aren't on the boat anymore. Your clothes feel warm and dry, and the air smells clean. You're standing in a featureless, white space. Alone, except for an indistint shadow, black with fuzzy outlines, and two glowing red eyes. It speaks in a strange voice, that sounds like many voices speaking as one.

"A pity. You could have been so powerful."

And then, you are back on the boat.

# post-battle

The storm has ended. Cronn throws open the hatches and begins yelling to his crew. With the storm clear, you can see the mouth of the river Roor, and the 3 Imperial ships wrecked there.

Cronn: "We're taking on more water than we can handle, we need to beach this boat now or we're all going under"

On the nearest beach, you can see sailors regrouping, some wounded, some moving. They are staring at the sky, at the storm that has miraculously disappeared.

As you beach the boat, the sailors look at each other. Unsure of what to do. One among them speaks up "As you were, sailors. We were all of Roorsven before we were Esmerian. And these people have just saved Roorsven."

"We won't report that we saw you here, and most of the loyal Empire folks went south to some mountain town called Emmnor. So you should be okay to move about Roorsven as you please."

A little later, the four of you notice something a little different. You find you have some measure of control over your dark elements.

You understand how Elemental surge works: If 2 or more members of the party are bloodied, you deal an additional 1d10 elemental damage on attacks.

Elemental control: once per day, if you can use your element to help in a skill check, gain advantage on that check. Example: Drang is trying to kick down a door, so he makes it decay a little bit before kicking.
