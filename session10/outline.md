## Campfire

The rain has not let up for a minute. Sometimes it's a drizzle, sometimes it's a downpour. Right now it's a a thick mist, about the best it's been since you started moving south.

Where have you found to camp for the day?

What does the camp look like? Who is doing what?

What are you talking about?

when you swing the sword, a red outline appears where the blade once was, and it cuts as if it were whole. Then, as quickly as it appeared, the glow is gone.

Drang, you recall a memory that doesn't belong to you. Someone from the past weilded this sword... What were they like?

## Meeting at the barn

Torshuul and Morelian have set up a makeshift base inside the derelict barn. There is an array of arcane instruments around the edge of the barn, with various implements pointing out of the windows and making quiet, inscrutable noises. Torshuul has a camp area set up with several sleeping pallets. He is standing by a table, working on butchering a deer.

Torshuul: They are looking for you in the city. They seem to have figured out you were here several days ago. They are watching the Crossroads Inn very closely, but they didn't follow you North.

Something changed yesterday, and now the Storm power seems focused in the North sea.

* make an items table in case they want to go to BLADE
* Morelian uses his instruments to determine the energy has moved to the North sea
* Need to get a boat:

Can buy a small boat for about 5k gold. (expense report it) But how to do it incognito?

Can try to comission a ride from a trader/freelancer. Will cost 500g for a keelboat, or 3k to comission a warship or trading galley.

There are pirates docked in the north sea right now you could convince to sail for you. Will got 25g/head (500g) plus 100 for the captain.

### Dock mechanics

periodically roll perception for guards. The DC is 25 - the suspcion level

raise suspicion level over time or if they do attention-getting things

If the guards find them, they yell out. It becomes combat

If suspicion gets above 10:

Bandor notices a kid obviously eyeballing you.

If ingored, he will fail to pickpocket and leave a note. "Meet tonight at the Weevil's Roost in Undertown if you're looking for a ship"

A short dwarf dressed in short shorts and no shirt. Bodhi is wearing a necklace made of shells and has a sunbleached hair and beard.

Has a keelboat

Will let them borrow keel for half price (250g) if they do the thrill seeker angle.

Has a crew of 3 other beach dwarves. They will fight

* Trade prince Grex Hadvar

Early 20s human. Very well built and good-looking, wearing leather armor under silk sailors outfit. Very pro-empire. Will report if he figures out who the party is, or if they express anti-empire sentiment

Has a trading galley

3k to comission. Crew will not fight. Requires a promise that the ship will be replaces in full if damaged.

* Yemma the Shipsmith

Middle aged woman. Has been selling and making ships at this dock for 30 years.

Has an older keelboat. Will let it go for 5k.

Can tell who the party is but does not give a fuck.

* Cronn the Wind Breaker

Half orc pirate

Does not understand why his name is funny

Has met Drang before, when Drang was a teen.

Will got 25g/head (500g) plus 100 for the captain. (600 total, but he will get the math wrong and say 800)

boat is a pirate warship. 6 pirates will join the fight.

* Old Gil

Old-ish halfing. Down on his luck. Just needs some money to buy goods and he'll be back on top

Has a trading ship, but not much else. His crew has left.

He'll let you ride for 2k, plus 500 to hire a temp crew.

Crew won't fight, and will mutiny halfway to the sea because Gil sucks so bad.

* Captain Arla "The sea tamer"

Human Druid, she uses her powers over the sea to help pilot her ship. Has short hair and a seaweed woven clothing

Very loyal crew

Crew won't fight, but Arla can use her powers to block the storm boss at times

3k for ride. Half price if they let her in on the dark elements.
