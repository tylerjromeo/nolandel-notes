## Meeting at the barn

Torshuul and Morelian have set up a makeshift base inside the derelict barn. There is an array of arcane instruments around the edge of the barn, with various implements pointing out of the windows and making quiet, inscrutable noises. Torshuul has a camp area set up with several sleeping pallets. He is standing by a table, working on butchering a deer.

Torshuul: They are looking for you in the city. They seem to have figured out you were here several days ago. They are watching the Crossroads Inn very closely, but they didn't follow you North.

Something changed yesterday, and now the Storm power seems focused in the North sea.

The weather is starting to get worse

* try to drop a hint about Drang's sword
* make an items table in case they want to go to BLADE
* Morelian uses his instruments to determine the energy has moved to the North sea
* Need to get a boat:

Can buy a small boat for about 10k gold. (expense report it) But how to do it incognito?

Can try to comission a ride from a trader/freelancer

There are pirates docked in the north sea right now you could convince to sail for you
