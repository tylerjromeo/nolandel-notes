Last session we:
* Decided to head to Hammerfast to investigate the Decay, at JoJo's behest.
* Drang got fitted for some plate mail that will be ready soon
* Duur-Ima learned from Jojo that Kaurian Graves has established a "Public Safety Initiative" group that is rooting out anti-imperials, and they are headed slowly towards Emmnor
* Travelled South from Roorsven while Duur-Ima, Henry, and Drang engaged in marshmallow shenanigans.
* To avoid an Imperial checkpoint, took a detour through a tunnel under the Snow-Shield mountains
* Kicked down a door with an absurd maze on it and found a bunch of gold and a wand of webs
* Disabled a trap to get through to Yiva the Dragon-Kepper, and his elderly dragon.
* Henry wanted to get some dragon gold, but ultimately the group agreed to pass through and defeat some spider monsters in exchange for a "boon" at some point in the future.
* Fought a Drider/spider combo, Duur-Ima had a near death experience
* short rest and then emerge at the other side of the cave
