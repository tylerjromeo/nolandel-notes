## JoJo's info:

"Here's what my folks on the ground are saying. The Empire has left a small force in Roorsven, but not much. They have a lot of their bureaucrats and artificers heading west to the Imperial Weapons research outpost. Their military is heading south. Kourian Graves, that guy who tried to arrest us in Orreton, has started a "Public Safety Initiative" that is rooting out anti-Imperials. They are planning to move south slowly towards Emmnor, making many stops on the way. Not sure why Emmnor is their destination, but it may become difficult for you to travel Where PSI has recently been active. We'll keep an eye on their location.

# Blade council

# Travel

montage over a few days: each person do a "montage scene"

Henry snatches a ham and a bag of apples from a bandit camp

Duur-Ima practices katas near a pond to a rhythm played by Bandor

# secret tunnel

You learn from some friendly locals that there is an Imperial checkpoint on the main road going <direction>. After consulting some maps, you find the only way to proceed is through a tunnel under the Snow-Shield mountain range.

You make it to the point where the tunnel opens, and see outside, someone has built a very large bonfire. Someone who looks familiar.

Pyrus binding: "guard the entrance of this tunnel, and don't let any strangers pass. Don't tell anyone what's in this cave"

# Traps

boulders fall at entrance (pressure plate). DC 18 to disarm. DC 15 to detect (unless they drang right onto it)

Arcane ward at south entrace to dragon lair

illusary boulders blocking other entrance.

# Stupid undertale joke:

* Yellow tiles are electric, they will electrocute you
* Green tiles are alarms. If you step on one, you will have to fight a monster
* orange tiles are orange scented. They will make you smell delicious
* blue tiles are water tiles, swim through if you like, but if you smell like oranges, the pirahnas will bite you
* also if a blue tile is next to a yellow tile, the water will also zap you
* purple tiles are slippery, you will slide to the next tile
* However, the slippery soap smells like lemons! Which pirahnas do not like
* pink tiles dont do anything

## rewards:
