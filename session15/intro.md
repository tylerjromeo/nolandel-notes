As you each wake up, you notice a copy of the Hammer Times has been pushed under your doors. The headlines read: "Market district cracks down on illegal marshmallow sales" and "Cave operation costs increase as Kobolds unionize"

Drang you have a second piece of paper under your door. It's a note from JoJo. It says "Someone from BLADE dropped off your plate mail at Ol' Sammy's this morning. In front of my door. I can only open my door about 8 inches. Please come get your suit of armor."
