Drang you're 6 years old, exploring the aftermath of a grisly raid by shining skull. Sturm is walking around with his brothers, settling disuptes over loot. What are you doing?

as you walk, you trip over something. Looking back as you stumble, you see a body huddled on teh ground, stripped of his boots and with an arrow in his belly. 

This body still seems to be breathing...

As you each wake up, you notice a copy of the Hammer Times has been pushed under your doors. The headlines read: "Market district cracks down on illegal marshmallow sales" and "Cave operation costs increase as Kobolds unionize"

Drang you have a second piece of paper under your door. It's a note from JoJo. It says "Someone from BLADE dropped off your plate mail at Ol' Sammy's this morning. In front of my door. I can only open my door about 8 inches. Please come get your suit of armor."
