JoJo meets them and tells drang his armor is ready

Shitmouth takes them to the catacombs

Catacombs are ever changing (tartarus) but if you've lived there for years you can get around. Children always find their way out. Many get lost forever.

Fight a "flesh golem" (or flee)

Area encased in flesh-stone. Find a way through

Inside is mummified Orrelle. He's written a journal about his and Zaar's job, and how Zaar betrayed and trapped him.

Shitmouth gives them a waystone to find their way under the greate gray tower

Next steps:

JoJo - Has armor. In the sinkhole. Not much of useful information. Can use as a generic hint kiosk

Sheara - Has a big party that night in the gilded garden. Having to buy new refreshments

Crag - Investigated the carnage outside the gates. Has an idea of where the orcs have gone and is planning on shoring up defenses

Valtaria - Has gone into the woods, Things are getting bad there. Skeleton animal squad: Brown Bear, Dire Wolf, Giant Boar, Giant Elk, Giant Toad, Saber-tooth tiger

Shitmouth - scared as hell

Sturm - using new power to raid all over. Waiting for the wall to fall so that he can raid Hammerfast. Will notice Drang's sword and envy it

Zaar - Has promised Sturn that the wall will fall (really the wall doesn't matter)

Jarrus - Holed up in his house, furiously sending letters. There is a "reaper" in his house who will kill him if he behaves abnormally. The party can rescue him. The reaper is his butler. Butler answers door, asks them to leave. Mayor is upstairs in office.
