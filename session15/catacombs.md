You meet Shitmouth and he takes you down an ally and down a set of stone stairs into the catacombs. As he heads down he lights two torches, and holds one out for somebody else to take.

"Okay, now all of you stay real fuckin' close. If you lose sight of me you won't be able to find your way out, and I'm not doing a damn search party today."

The catacombs walls are about half stonework and half naturally formed. The air is cold and the smell of damp earth is all around. Here and there, you see some sunlight coming from entrances back up into the city, but mostly the darkness is broken only by your torches.

Shitmouth leads the way through the twisting corridor slowly. Often he stops and holds his torch to the wall to read some markings, or else feeling the texture of the cave floor. One time he stops for a long time at an intersection, smelling the air of each path before choosing one. (survival) Your sense of direction is confused by this place. You just took 4 right turns in a row, and yet you're in a completely different hallway than before.

(if asked) "The rules don't really work the same in this shithole. You gotta live down here a while before you really get the place. It always leads children back to the surface, but most unlucky fuckers just starve down here without a guide"

# arrival 
"Tada, here's the place, assholes. Were under the Great Gray Tower. Used to be you could store something safely here. Can't fuckin' get to it now though."

# the barrier

You're in an open portion of cave with all natural walls and many pillars. Things feel a little weird here. Your body feels heavier and you're tired. As you walk around, your feet splash ni small puddles on the ground.

The wall ahead has a strange, red glow. Shitmouth stops in his tracks "What the fuck is that?"

The glow disappears abruptly, and something starts to grow on the two pillars. Very quickly, you see a mass come form the pillars, growing towards the center and joining together with a wet sound. The mass is pink, red and gray. A wet conglomoration of muscle, skin, and blood vessels.

The flesh wall churns, and a crude mouth forms in its center, You see a balloon of skin filling with air beneath the mouth, deflating as the mouth speaks "Go away. You are not welcome here"

# the fight

The flesh wall detaches from the pillars and forms a lump on the ground. That lump begins to form arms and legs. dozens of arms and legs pull the mass forward, forming and deforming to propel it as it advances on you.

# The room

With the monster defeated, the way into the chamber is open. Purple light pours out of the entrance. You see an orb sitting on a pedestal in the center of the chamber, pulsing with dark energy.

`Standing 20 feet away ages you 1 year/hour. 5 feet away is 1 year/minute. touching it is 100 years in a minute.`

On the ground by the pedestal is a crumbling, mummified body with short, white hair. The body has a rotten book clutched in his hands.

The book appears to be a ledger of goods, but written on top of the faded columns is a fresher message.

If you're reading this note, it did not work and I am dead. Mayor Hanotar hired me and an orc named Zaar to bring this thing down below the gray tower. After I put it here, the orc split the thing in two, and trapped me in here with half of it. I hate this orb. It makes me feel weak the closer I get to it. I'm tired of waiting, I'm going to knock it down. If you're reading this, find my wife, Arlene, and tell her Orelle is Vacationing in Ushad. Then kill Jens Hanotar and that fucking orc Zaar for me.
