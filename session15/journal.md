This session we:

* Traveled into the catacombs beneath the Great Gray Tower with our boy Shitmouth
* Defeated the flesh monster that was guarding the inner Chamber
* Found a strange purple orb, which cause Duur-Ima to magically age 15 years
* Found dead, ancient Orelle by the orb, and recovered his journal.
* Drang spoke to the orb in Primordial, and it responded only with "A B H A V A"
* Drang approached the Abhava, and hit it (crit it) accross the room, and it hit back.
* Shitmouth gave you a waystone which will allow you to navigate the catacombs and return to this place.
* paid Shitmouth (50g) for his trouble
* Learned from Shitmouth that Orelle's wife, Arlene, is in the Bronze district with their family
* Learned from JoJo that Crag is hanging out at The Garrison, Sheara is setting up a party at the Gilded Garden, and Valtaria has gone into the woods
