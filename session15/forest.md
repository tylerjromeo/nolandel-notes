Near the city walls, Moradin's wood has decayed. The ground is covered with brown leaves and many trees have lost their bark, replaced with a pungent mold. As you proceed, however, the decay lessens and the forest goes back to normal.

A little ways into the healthy section of the forest, you see a familiar face. Valtaria!

(She is trying to see what has changed in the forest to stop the spread)

You make your way to the Center of the forest. This is a place you know well, Kiri. An open clearing canopied by thick branches which block out much of the sunlight. There is a small shrine for druidic rituals but other than that, this place is fully natural.

Valtaria stops suddenly. "This place feels... wrong."

"The energies of Hell are present here, I can feel it."

The illusion is broken, and you see the truth. On the forest floor are long burn marks tracing out a shape.

there is a rustling in the brush, and animals appear. A boar, a toad, an elk, a panther, and a bear. But they are not normal animals. Their skin has been marked with dark symbols. Their eyes glow red and their mouths drip with green and yellow slime.
