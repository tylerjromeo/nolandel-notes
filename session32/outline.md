# flashback

walk through Harold's betrayal

* escaping the scene
* hiding the take
* blaming Henry for the trap

# The mechanism

"catalyst" is suspended in a matrix of smoke.

THere is a map of nolandel on the wall controlling where smoke is "focused" (on the war front)

The blade wand is embedded in the guts of the mechanism

If they use the scroll on teh catalyst, it teleports away. There is unchecked energy -> boss fight

If they remove the wand, catelyst is dropped through the floor. Smoke energy is untethered -> boss fight

# Smoke boss

adds?

# The aftermath

The *second* the banishment ritual is complete, the 4 of them go elemental.

You feel a tugging on your soul, trying to pull you through into another plane.

Whimsy comes out, eyes glowing blue. He speaks with teh voice of Yiva the dragon keeper.

"By the power of Dragon-kind, I bind these creatures to their home plane. Take them not from here, interloper!"

Kiri you see their images double, like two photographs superimposed, struggling. tethers of energy tie the physical forms of your friends to Whimsy, as the elemental forms are pulled in a direction that you can't see, that doesn't make sense.

There's a crash, and a swirling of debris all around you, suddenly you see sky above your head. A storm is raging. 

Bandor, Drang, Duur-Ima, and Henry are all standing still with blank expressions on their faces. Kiri, you see JoJo, Morelian, and Eirina descending on gliders overhead.

<escape>

Bandor, Drang, Duur-Ima, and Henry, you see all this happening in the third person. You're floating up from it into the storm, but your bodies are down below, moving and alive, but without awareness or understanding.

# Ruin

The four of you awaken to find yourselves in an empty world of whiteness. You can see each other, all in your elemental forms. The only other thing you see is a throne, 20 feet high made of jagged black stone. Sitting in the throne is a being. He stands up and descends from the throne. He stands over 9 feet tall, his chest and shoulders are broad and muscled. His skin is black and silver, scaly and shimmering. In place of hair, he has a plume of firey orange energy streaming from his head down his neck and shoulders.

"My children, you have done well. Welcome to my home"

## Things ruin did:
Manipulated almruil into founding Blade
got party together
Brought blade to find them
Got the emperor to gather distilled storm in 1 place
planted Drang's sword
showed Kiri the prophecy
Manipulated Marwen to put the abhava beneath Hammerfast
Chose the location for Hesterston
Gave Nalen visions of Shar approaching
Taught Empire wizards how to use an anchor in the plane of air to spread smoke

all in service of:
Allowing the dark elements to pass through the souls of those touched by its power. Allowing them to convert Nolandel into their own plane

## What ruin wants
His own growing plane
For the party to return to nolandel and spread their influence
To not be overshadowed by the "false elements"

## Complicationss
They still have human wills, because their bodies are still alive (Ruin can wait this out, he's already been waiting 50,000 years)
He's done this plan before, and it usually fails. This is the first time it has gotten this far.
