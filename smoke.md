# Plane of air

Empire has reverse engineered the teleportation technoligy in the wand, and uses it to transport Smoke into the Air plane, using B.L.A.D.E. hq as an anchor

While this is active, Imperials with smoke weapons can draw smoke from the air.

The air at the border with Ushad is very bad, but this advantage is allowing the empire to press into Ushad like never before.

# Machine City Glenham

Machine City Glenham is a city of gears, clockwork and machines. It supplies machine parts and precision metalwork for all of Nolandel. The city is the home to The Craftsman's guild, and the vast majority of master craftsmen live in Glenham. The city is divided into several borouighs, including the Military borough, where soldiers live; crafter's borough, where the guild hall and workshops are; research borough, a new area for the imperial's new research facility; religious borough, where the temple of Primus is housed; steel borough home of the mysterious mute automotons that Imperials call "warforged", and the living borough, where housing food, and other necessities for life can be found. The city also has a parcel of swampy forest near its center, housing a vibrant community of druids. The population of Machine City Glenham is majority halfling, with many gnomes, dwarves and elves. The human population is on the rise, particularly in the research quarter, where Imperials have set up an self-contained community.

"secret" weapons research facility that everyone knows about

Harold of Tangrell has gone full imperial, but he's planning a heist.

The smoke weapons are disrupting the balance, they won't need guards and his people will go hungry

Need to do something about the arcane matrix

## Social



## Political

Crafter's guild is a powerful political force, although it has lost power. The city is ruled by a council of 11, represtenting the numbers on a clock, where the 12 o' clock position is a citizen chosen by lottery every month. The longer you serve on the council, the "later" your number is and the greater your prestige. Traditionally legislation is only introduced by the 8,9,10, and 11 o clock councilors. Councilors run for re-election every year on the solstice, and the 11 nominees with the most votes sit for 1 year.

The council meets in a giant clocktower in the center of town. It is an advanced and enchanted building with the capability of shifting to create extra rooms as needed.

## Economic

the central 1/3 of the city is an imperial "company town" centered on the weapons facility. Most who live there rarely leave. It is a self-contained city with it's own vendors and artisans.

Before the Empire the city was known for its fine steelwork, producing arcane and mechanical components with incredible precision. Halflings and gnomes do well here due to their nimble fingers. The crafter's guild has had a schism of late between those who went to work in the new weapons facility and those who did not want to support the empire.

## Religious

subculture of warforged who worship the "creator" and the "arcane"

Warforged can create other warforged with the assistance of a wizard, but it si unknown how the first one came about. Warforged do not worship gods or believe they have "souls" in the traditional sense. They are "enkindled" rather than born, and believe in reincarnation through enkindling.

# Henry story

The biggest turning point of Henry’s life was the betrayal by his brother and the following imprisonment by the Esmerian government. Henry and his older brother, Harold, grew up as orphans in Tangrell. Harold is two years older. Their parents were murdered when Henry was 6 years old. Henry and Harold lived on the streets and quickly became involved with the Thieves Guild in Tangrell. They were both very good at it and rose in the ranks.
When Henry was 22, he and Harold were on a major heist job. In the process, fire was set to the building. The two thieves grabbed what they could to finish the job, pushing their luck as thieves often do. Smoke filled the building. When they tried to escape, the way was blocked because of the fire. The authorities arrived as they sought escape, alerted by the smoke rising from the building.
[Harold betrayed Henry in some way to get himself out and escape from the guards. This resulted in Henry being captured by the guards and sent to jail. Henry probably almost died from the smoke or something. The Thieves Guild did not make any attempt to get Henry out of trouble, and he was sent to prison for 15 years.]
Henry left Esmeria as soon as he was released from prison. He knew if he got in trouble with the empire again, he’d be in prison for life. He also felt abandoned and betrayed by his brother and the guild, so there was no home for him in Tangrell.

(You could include a scene some years before the Incident with smoke as well if you want. It might also be cool to have something in prison with smoke, but I have no ideas for either scenario. Just offering that in case you want more to draw from than what I wrote.)
(Also a quick reminder, Henry is only 52. He acts much older than he actually is.)
