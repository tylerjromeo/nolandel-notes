# Plane of air

Empire has reverse engineered the teleportation technoligy in the wand, and uses it to transport Smoke into the Air plane, using B.L.A.D.E. hq as an anchor

While this is active, Imperials with smoke weapons can draw smoke from the air.

The air at the border with Ushad is very bad, but this advantage is allowing the empire to press into Ushad like never before.

# Heist mission 

# Machine City Glenham

"secret" weapons research facility that everyone knows about

Harold of Tangrell has gone full imperial, but he's planning a heist.

The smoke weapons are disrupting the balance, they won't need guards and his people will go hungry

Need to do something about the arcane matrix

# Henry story

The biggest turning point of Henry’s life was the betrayal by his brother and the following imprisonment by the Esmerian government. Henry and his older brother, Harold, grew up as orphans in Tangrell. Harold is two years older. Their parents were murdered when Henry was 6 years old. Henry and Harold lived on the streets and quickly became involved with the Thieves Guild in Tangrell. They were both very good at it and rose in the ranks.
When Henry was 22, he and Harold were on a major heist job. In the process, fire was set to the building. The two thieves grabbed what they could to finish the job, pushing their luck as thieves often do. Smoke filled the building. When they tried to escape, the way was blocked because of the fire. The authorities arrived as they sought escape, alerted by the smoke rising from the building.
[Harold betrayed Henry in some way to get himself out and escape from the guards. This resulted in Henry being captured by the guards and sent to jail. Henry probably almost died from the smoke or something. The Thieves Guild did not make any attempt to get Henry out of trouble, and he was sent to prison for 15 years.]
Henry left Esmeria as soon as he was released from prison. He knew if he got in trouble with the empire again, he’d be in prison for life. He also felt abandoned and betrayed by his brother and the guild, so there was no home for him in Tangrell.

(You could include a scene some years before the Incident with smoke as well if you want. It might also be cool to have something in prison with smoke, but I have no ideas for either scenario. Just offering that in case you want more to draw from than what I wrote.)
(Also a quick reminder, Henry is only 52. He acts much older than he actually is.)
