Last session we:
* held a brief funeral for Nalen
* rode owls back to the edge of the burning Emmnor woods. On the way saw many of the Imperials leaving. Drang's owl was shot on the way down
* Met with the elves of the wood, plus JoJo and Joe Pesci + the hangliding halflings, who came to help
* Kiri turned henry into a giant eagle, and he flew in with Drang on his back to take down the trebuchet which was menacing the woods
* The crew for the trebuchet had three magic smoke weapons, which deal 3d10 damage to anything within 300 feet (no save or attack roll) but must be reloaded.
* After clearing the way, Emmnorians and Hesterstonians startied to argue with each other. Bandor calmed them with a song, and Itham and Parris agreed to peace talks
* back in the woods, Kiri tracked a werewolf to where he was hiding
* Bandor convincced the wolf to donate some blood to help "save a sick girl"
* The werewolf was not Fenris Lycan, it was his cousin Richard. They both agreed to help and gave a vial of werewolf blood. In return Henry gave them 15 gold. Henry and Bandor both got some delicious meat pies from Fenris.
* JoJo let the team know what Lamruil is furious about the Empire decveloping Smoke weapons, and wants the team to go to the Machine City of Glenham immediatly. He has also suspended all teleportation until the missing wand can be found.
* Eirina is travelling with the group to teach Duur-Ima about archery and combat, for her re-spec to battlemaster fighter!
