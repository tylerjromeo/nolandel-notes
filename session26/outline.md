# overview
Woods have some low-burning sections, but they are under control by elves using create water. They can't last forever

Itham is in the woods trying to rally more support, he's been moderately successful (120 or so are helping)

Eirinia and JoJo have been leading strike squads to take down the trebuchets. They have taken out 3 by sneaking through high grain, but that approach won't work for the last one.

Joe Pesci/team are grounded, the smoke weapons totally neutralize their advantage. He is tending to the wounds of one of his halflings.

Parris will wake up at a dramatically appropriate time and shield someone/somethign from imperial attack

In hesterston, folks are uncomfortable with how the imperials are acting, but unsure how to proceed because Parris is gone. Millicent is trying to get them to stop, but is ineffective.

At PSI camp, a lot of imperials are just leaving. They were enthralled by Shar's influence, which has just been broken. The prison carraiges are largely unguarded.

Imperials have posted up around their one remaining trebuchet. They have a bonfire which they are using to refill their smoke weapons. They are in an open field and cannot be approached. They are flinging burning pitch at the woods every 10-15 minutes. They are acting leaderless and have sort of taken over the town.

New Imperial "leader" running the trebuchet: Corwin "frosty" Corraidon

# Hook for next time

We see a horse and rider, galloping full tilt through the darkness up an open path. He's headed towards an inn, where another rider waits. The horse comes to a halt at the inn, exhausted, and the rider jumps down. He hands a package to his relief "Go fast an true, this is what he's been looking for". The second rider nods and rides off, at full speed, to deliver that BLADE teleportation wand to its destination...
