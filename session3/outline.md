# Back in Town

Downstairs the arguement is between the patrons and a couple of imperial guard. Outside, you hear the voice of Orin Cragjaw loud and clear: "You're not taking control of my mine, and you're not going to keep us from leaving this town!"

"What I have here is an Imperial writ giving me the authority to do just that. If you'll cooperate we'll get everything back to normal in a few weeks. Calm yourself down Orin."

You hear the sound of shouting and children crying as you look around. The guards are roughly shoving everyone who has come outside back into their homes.

The Empire has showed up. They have closed the mine, and put the town in Lockdown.

Plan on doing research on the arcane energy. "You won't even need this mine! The arcane powers are going to make you all rich! Don't you understand that?"

See Guard Captian (recurring character)

Kourian Graves. Ambitious, ruthless, loyal, capable.

A grizzled, very tall middle aged man. He is dressed in full plate mail, but without his helmet on. He carries an enormous sword across his back

Either just leave, or fight 4x guards plus the captian. Captian has a smoke weapon and can do a blade warp

JoJo: "I'm headed south to investigate some new readings we got... I need to get out of here quickly and quietly. Let's just sneak past these guys out of town"

Kourian is way tougher than the party, have a backup plan (cages in camp, or maybe in the mine) in case they go toe-to-toe.

Catch a glimpse of Boyland. He's bandaged up and leaning on a post, but is walking.

## Letter from Morelian

I hope this note finds you well.

Enclosed are the arcane readings from our Mephit experiment. I hope you might bring them to my colleague Yaldobath in Roorsven. They keep a low profile selling arcane trinkets under-the-table. Only Yaldobath has the know how to interpret this data and help me understand if my conclusions are correct.

Yours, Morelian

Attached are several sheets of paper covered in numbers, runes, and diagrams in the tiniest writing you can imagine.

## Transit

After a few hours of travel, you hear the sound of shouting in the distance.

You see a man driving a one-horse cart in your direction at a wild speed. He's swerving on and off the road and his wheels are clacking loudly on the rocks. Suddenly, the cart lurches over to the side. The horse screams as the cart pulls it down. The man scrambles forward and quickly detatches the horse's harness, and it runs off. Just then, he looks up and notices you there, then he turns backwards to look at the creatures pursuing him.

Merchant's horses are being attacked by sabre tooth tiger and cub

If they save the guy, he'll give them a ride.

## In Roorsven

From a distance, you see the Great Waterfall of Roorsven. The two-tiered city is an exercise in contrast, the opulence of the Wallted High-town clashes greatly with the simpler, open sprawl of Low-town. You can see the Grand Elevator moving to the side of the waterfall.

There is a path leading to a single gate to enter High-town, Lowtown is approachable on all sides.

### Hightown

two guard wearing Imperial uniforms start to either side of the open portcullis into Hightown. There is a light crowd around the gate, preparing to enter the city.

Past the gate, Hightown Roorsven is a well-kept, clean city. Salesmen call tastefully at you from open storefronts, and you feel a light bump at your back as some children rush by you, laughing.

Empire is pretty well accepted here.

Will need to gather information about where/who $NAME is.

TODO: map out a half dozen locations in $MEDIUM_CITY

Name is in lockup currently. Will have to do a Prison Break later.

### Lowtown

Filled with imperial propoganda

#### Residential area

#### farms

#### Market square

### Undertown

The shaded arean beneath the overhand of the cliff, Undertown is either lit by gas lamps all day or not lit at all. Many Drow and dwarf families prefer to live here. It has a bad reputation for crime.


## Yaldobath

Hermit, but very welcoming. Introduces the concept that the part has something innate about them that is attuned to Dark Elementals. Working as an illegal artificer, so will be hard to track down.

Tiefling, half made of arcane energy

## $MEDIUM CITY
