Last session we:

* Heard Orin arguing with Kourian Graves, the Imperial officer who wanted to take control of the mine/the town
* Kourian and Duur-Ima recognized each other
* Told Kourian that you fought against a terrible beast in the mine
* Stood up for Orin when he attacked Kourian
* Drove Kourian out of town, killing his men
* As he was surrendering, Drang killed one of the guards.
* Orin was thankful for your help defending the village; the party left in a hurry.

* Headed towards Roorsven, the teired city, to find Yaldobath, who is Morelian's colleage
* Saved the Merchant, Fancy Bacall, from wild tigers.
