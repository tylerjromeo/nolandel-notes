# Intro

You wake up with your ears ringing and your eyes burning. Smoke fills the air around you. There's pressure on your shin, something heavy is pinning your leg to the ground. You hear a muffled voice shouting something. It's Harold. His silhouette is standing several feet away, backlit through a hole blown in the side of the cellar. He's looking around and yelling. He rushes back into the cellar. Your leg is still pinned, the smoke is getting thicker.

Harold grabs the case of stolen goods, and scrambles out of the cellar. There's a load crash as a burning beam falls beside you. The heat is overwhelming.

Suddenly, the pressure is lifted from your leg, and a hand grasps your wrist, pulling you out of the building.

You get out into the street, cool air fills your lungs. But the hand doesn't let go. The guard pushes you down to the ground binds your wrists with manacles. "Well well, looks like we caught a theif"
