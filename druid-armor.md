Armor that grants +2 ac while in morph.

I have written to Yaldobath, and they have informed me the shapeshifting armor can be made, but it is difficult. It will require some time, some gold, and some hard to find supplies. The supplies we will need are as follows.

* A Moon's Tear gemstone (dark moon has these)
* A vial of a Were-creature's blood
* Something imbued with the essence of the one who will wear the armor (hair or something)
* A cutting from the Heart Tree of an ancient forest
