Armor that grants +2 ac while in morph.

I have written to Yaldobath, and they have informed me the shapeshifting armor can be made, but it is difficult. It will require some time, some gold, and some hard to find supplies. The supplies we will need are as follows.

* A Moon's Tear gemstone (dark moon has these)
* A vial of a Were-creature's blood
* Something imbued with the essence of the one who will wear the armor (hair or something)
* A cutting from the Heart Tree of an ancient forest

# Moon's Tear
The moon's tear is believed to be a gift from the moon. It is said that one falls down from the moon every night that it is full. Planar researchers consider them a curiousity, and sometimes collect them if they fall nearby, but Dark Moon has found arcance uses for the Moon's tear

Powdered moons tear can be used to create a poison that will stop ones heart for 28 days, then restart it.

A moon's tear set in a magic want increases the potency of transmutation magic

a silver blade set with moons tears can burn a shapeshifter's body, and force them to return to their true form

ritual glyphs, when drawn with moon's tear powder, connect more potently with Shar, and other night gods.
