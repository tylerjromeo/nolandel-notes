Last session we:
* Continued the fight against Kourian Graves
* He split into 4 shadow monks, which were defeated
* He reformed into a shadow warrior, and Nalen came to defend Duur-Ima
* Once Kourian was defeated, the shadow souls of all Shar's followers burst from his body, looking for a new host
* Duur-Ima resisted, so they started to take Nalen
* Nalen gave Duur-Ima an impossible choice, let her become Shar's Avatar, or kill her.
* Duur-Ima killed her mentor, Nalen, and in doing so Shar was left with no viable hosts. Shar will be banished from the world for 1000 years
* On the horizon, Smoke is rising from Emmnor.
