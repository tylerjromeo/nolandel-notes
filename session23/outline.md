# Intro

return to village, things are fucked? 

find a caravan abandoned in the road with dead nearby


Beatrice is still alive. Explains that Famine came hard and fast. There was not enough stored. The hunters tried to hunt, the traders tried to travel, but no one returned. Everyone strong enough to leave is gone, everyone too weak has starved

(possibly next round)

Beatrice did a cannibalism because she was taking care of the children... but the children didn't survive and now she can't live with herself. She's going to suicide-attack D-I

# The next ward

fite with shield guardian

The shield weakens

# Parris reacts

"you're going to let it out, it'll destroy the village"

"it's some elf thing, the empire should be here any day to sort it all out."

*trumpet in the distance*

That's them now! Listen, you're too strong for me to stop you, but if you go in there I can't let you out until the Empire clear you and you get the Blessing of Lathander

<!-- Just as you are about to head in, you get the flash: -->

# Nalen flash (adjust the timing on this as dramatically appropriate)

You're sitting, legs crossed in your hermitage. Your eyes are closed and you can feel everything, but you have no control over your body. You feel your mouth open and speak "Hello Duur-Ima"

It's Nalens voice.

Your eyes open and you see Nalen's arms and body. Your muscles feel tight and your body feels older

"I wanted to say a quick goodbye. Shar has been sending us dreams... Maybe you're better than me at blocking Her voice... But I can feel it coming. The one who has been hunting Shar's followers. He's climbing the mountain now"

Nalen stands up and grabs a pair of wakizashi swords from under a floorboard
