* Garrison
    * Crag is there trying to get the Imperials to release some troops and drive off "the orcs"
    * Can't make any headway
    * Imperial's name is "Henderson Edgeworth" and he's fuckin useless. Bureaucrat insisting on a "signed and notorized letter of intention from the area's provisional governor" or else he's "welcome to come to an Empire public outreach meeting on thursdays"
    * "Listen here, pal, I'm not some concerned citizen, I'm the captain of the guard and I'm trying to keep this town safe. When you Imperials moved in you said you were here in support of Hammerfast, well now's the time to show it. If you can't help me, bring back someone with a brain that I can talk to"
    * Crag has a theory that the orcs have set up camp in the old "treetops" outpost north of town.
