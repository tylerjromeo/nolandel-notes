* intro (drang just put on a kids boots backwards)

* Meet Arlene
    * 5 kids
    * Wants to suss out what the party knows
    * secretly an assassin
    * wants revenge on the mayor and Zaar

Options:
* Garrison
    * Crag is there trying to get the Imperials to release some troops and drive off "the orcs"
    * Can't make any headway
    * Imperial's name is "Henderson Edgeworth" and he's fuckin useless. Bureaucrat insisting on a "signed and notorized letter of intention from the area's provisional governor" or else he's "welcome to come to an Empire public outreach meeting on thursdays"
    * "Listen here, pal, I'm not some concerned citizen, I'm the captain of the guard and I'm trying to keep this town safe. When you Imperials moved in you said you were here in support of Hammerfast, well now's the time to show it. If you can't help me, bring back someone with a brain that I can talk to"
    * Crag has a theory that the orcs have set up camp in the old "treetops" outpost north of town.

* Mayors house
    * Arlene is there to kill the mayor (with or without the party)
    * Mayor reveals that he's been spending money to attract attention and that someone has been impersonating him
    * "He said I'd be killed if I gave it away, so I attracted attention the only way I know how! Through scandal! I spent money like crazy hoping that someone would come investigate"

* Treetop outpost
 * Shining Skull is there. Sturm is there
 * If Crag is with them, it's way more than he's willing to take on
 * Sturm remembers Drang by name, but belittles him
 * Zaar is there as Sturm's advisor
 * Sturm hasn't really noticed that Drang left.
 * The sword causes a major stir. Sturm wants to duel Drang for it.
 *

* Fund raiser party
    * Opulent
    * Could be a situation where you crash the party with teh real mayor. In that case Zaar will leave, and can be tracked to the shining skull camp.
