* intro (drang just put on a kids boots backwards)

Drang you hear the ragged breathing of the boy who's boots you put on get a little stronger, his head lifts up and he reaches a hand out towards you.

his fingers are cold and slippery with blood. The boys eyes take a long time to focus, but they find yours.

A long moment passes. The boy's lips are moving, just slightly, as if he's trying to speak.

Suddenly behind you you hear a voice, like a cracking whip "WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SON? THAT ONE'S ALREADY BEEN CHECKED"

* Meet Arlene
    * 5 kids
    * Wants to suss out what the party knows
    * secretly an assassin
    * wants revenge on the mayor and Zaar

Options:



* Treetop outpost
 * Shining Skull is there. Sturm is there
 * If Crag is with them, it's way more than he's willing to take on
 * Sturm remembers Drang by name, but belittles him
 * Zaar is there as Sturm's advisor
 * Sturm hasn't really noticed that Drang left.
 * The sword causes a major stir. Sturm wants to duel Drang for it.

    * Opulent
    * Could be a situation where you crash the party with teh real mayor. In that case Zaar will leave, and can be tracked to the shining skull camp.
