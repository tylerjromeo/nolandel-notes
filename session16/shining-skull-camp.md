On the path to the camp, you see a burnt out funeral pyre beside the road. It's huge, over 10 feet in a circle, and filled with ash, bone, and metal armor fragments.

(perception)
As you continue you see there are a pair of orcs in waiting up the road a bit. They haven't seen you yet.

"Turn around little ones. This ain't your territory"

(fight? Convince? They want sword?)

As you proceed up the path you see that the orc tribe has moved in and built some structures. There are large tents set up, and makeshift stables for horses. All around are dozens of campfires with orcs sitting around them, eating and talking and joking. Each orc seems to be holding or sitting on a small chest, keeping them well protected. Across the field, some orcs are doing target practice on a body, hung up from a tree.

Many of the trees around the camp have platforms, stairs, and even elevators build into them
