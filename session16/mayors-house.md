The mayor's manse is opulent and gaudy. In the lawn out front you see a ladder and several piles of tools, although no one appears to be working on it right now.

A man answers the door, wearing burgndy robes with black trim.

"Hello".

"How can I be of sssservice?"

"No. I am afraid the mayor will not be coming to the door today"

(this guy may or may not be a demon. I dunno. Improvise)

# inside

hidden things:
* journal: "Today I have purchased a journal. I will be sure to write in it every day. They say record-keeping is one of life's most important skills!" The entry is date 8 months ago. THere are no other entries.
* letter to builder: "I am not pleased with the windows on the upper floor, I am sure there is still a draft. Please replace them with pure volcanic glass. Name your price and I will pay it!"
* two gold bracelets with rubies. Worth 800g apiece. Inscribed with the mayor's name "Jens Hanotar"

The mayor is sitting at his desk, writing a letter. He's wearing a purple robe and a pair of spectacles on the tip of his nose. As he writes, his leg bounces up and down anxiously.

# assassin

Arlene is hidden in the garden, preparing to interrogate/assassinate the mayor.

* Mayors house
    * Arlene is there to kill the mayor (with or without the party)
    * Mayor reveals that he's been spending money to attract attention and that someone has been impersonating him
    * "He said I'd be killed if I gave it away, so I attracted attention the only way I know how! Through scandal! I spent money like crazy hoping that someone would come investigate"
