# intro

The gilded garden is a beautiful, outdoor botanical garden filled with birghtly colored flowers and intricate sculptures. A spiderweb of brick paths cut through the garden leading to trees, displays, art pieces, and tables and benches filled with people. Enchanted trays of fine food float around serving guests as they mingle. Everyone is dressed in their finest evening wear except for the security guards at the garden entrances in their armored uniforms.

Sheara catches your eye from accross the room and makes her way in your direction. "Hello! So glad you could all make it. Please enjoy yourselves!"


# Just improv in this awkward space.

# pawns:

Archibald Lorenz-Capufronz IV. An older man with a huge grey moustache and red cheeks wearing purple robes. Drunk and Rich. Has never visited the sinkhole

Yeul Urbosa. Ushadi expat elf with Crimson robes and bright green eyes. Haughty and too good for this party, but it would be a faux pas for him not to be here and donate more than Rience Thundergut.

Reince Thundergut. Dwarf wearing a velvet suit with gaudy rings and jewelry. New money. Hit a gold vein outside of town 30 years ago. Genuinely wants to help the sinkhole.


# Mayor

"Oh yes, Jens Hanotar is at the head table! He hasn't made a pledge yet but he always waits until the end of the night"

At the table, you see the Mayor. He's dressed in a brown doublet with gold trim and laughing as he talks to the woman beside him.


# Mayor found out

He stands up, surveying the situation before him. Then suddenly he throws something on the ground, the dias fills with smoke and there's a loud commotion

# dropped disguise

You see the figure wearing the mayors rogues, but he's not the same, he's shorter and stockioer now, and as you look in his face, you see the gray-green skin and lower tusks of an orc.

# chase scene:

out of the party, it's crowded with people. He's moving north towards the exit. People in the way

In the capitol district. There are pedestrians around but it's no longer crowded. He is duckign through alleys. He pulls dowjn a box of crates in your way

A large wagon full of chickens in crates moves in your way.

He enters the front door of a brothel, and exits the back.

He throws another vial of smoke at the front gate to get past the guards, they don't stop him, but they stop you.
