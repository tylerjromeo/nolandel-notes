As both an Elf and a monk, meditation should come easily for you. But tonight it doesn't. You see spiders and Shar in every dark corner and your mind refuses to quiet itself. You've taken to the streets of Hammerfast for a walk to calm down.

The night is calm and clear, great for visibility. There is a wide path just outside of the inn, untouched by decay. At this late hour it is very sparsely populated. 9 people in sight, none look suspcious. You look quickly over each of your shoulders and find no one behind you.

The alleyways are dark, but not too dark for you to see. You check each one before you pass. Some are occupied, some aren't. No one makes a move towards you. There is a sharp, sudden sound to your left, but it is only a man coughing. You scan the walls of the building and the tiles of the road for the secret symbols of the order of Dark Moon, but you find none.

As you are checking a bench, you hear someone approaching behind you. Soft quick steps. definitely getting louder. You don't turn. You shift your weight onto the balls of your feat, ready to dodge. The steps get louder. Too close. 5 feet away. This is it.

In one motion, you turn and grab the arm of your assailant. there is a sharp cray and you have him, arm twisted behind his back. Your left hand rears back, ready to strike.

"Ouch, ouch, oh no. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Please no."

You are holding the arm of a teenage boy, dressed in pale yellow robes. He has dropped a small paper card and a bundle of 3 morning glories on the ground. You let go and he immediately scampers away.

You pick up the fallen card. It says "In the dawn, beauty reigns, and the way is clearer. Blessings upon you. Services every day at dawn at the temple of Lathander, Divine quarter"

The night is calm and clear, great for visibility.
