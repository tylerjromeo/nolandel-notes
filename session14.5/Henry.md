Dice game. Learn that catacombs crew is just a loose term for professional criminals who aren't slavers.

Orrelle should have known better than to fuck with captial people

In the common room of the Frisky Ferret, there is a small group playing a dice game and talking quietly. On the edge of the table, there is a stack of 2 coins next to a stack of 7 coins. You understand the significance of these stacks among "professionals" and decide to join the game

The game is lively, the group welcomes out of towners and quickly, you are trading information. The dice clatter on the table meaninglessly as you talk. Coins move back and forth between all present.

The group is eager to hear about current events Roorsven and the shakeup with The Gardener and Yaldobath. In return they share some local goings on. 

The Catacombs Crew isn't really a guild or organization, but a name that law enforcement puts on any petty crime that's not slave trade. The catacombs themselves are dangerous, and only a select few can navigate them. There's potential money to be made in the Capitol District, if you can figure out who Orelle was working with before he disappeared. There was a caravan full of weapons and armor heading north, someone local was going to rip them off, but orc raiders beat them to it. THe empire doesn't come around much except in The Garrison and the Capitol district. Don't steal from anyone in the Sinkhole, or you'll get black-balled. Big rich people party coming up soon in the guilded garden if you're looking to pickpocket some jewelry.

As the dice continue to fall, the talk becomes less professional and more casual. The theif called Orlha begins to tell a story about a job he ran many years ago in Glenham. It's a boring story, until he gets to the part where he was nearly caught by the Captain of the Guard. A middle aged man by the name of "Harold of Tangrell"
