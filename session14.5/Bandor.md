Song about dual nature of Ayus and Abhava

You sit in your room at the end of the day, noodling on your instruments, when a poem comes into your head. You idly begin to write, not paying much attention. Your right hand is moving on its own as the other hand taps out a basic beat. You realize you've been writing for a while, and in front of you is written:

I am the truth
For the mind, a fountain of youth 
I am the devil 
I was in hevan, but i turned into a rebal 
I am immortality 
watching death and pain has become my reality 
I am the love in the air
a drug of sorts, take me if you dare
I am your daily woe 
that pit in your stomach comes straight from your soul
I am the chills you get
when you hold someones hand and it perfectly fits
I am the shot heard around the earth
Sparking revolution, it would'nt be a first
I am the good and the evil
and that will never change 
until there is no more life 
that will never change
