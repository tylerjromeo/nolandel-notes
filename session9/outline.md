Reynaud is outside of the cave. It's raining hard. He's gathered the dead bodies and is working on building a funeral pyre-boat. Among the wreackage is a broken barrel of distilled storm. Energy is floating upward out of the dust and into the sky.

Reynaud "We made a bad bet... We never should have gotten involved with those cultists, or the Empire."

"I had an honest life before the Empire came. All of the trade goes to the war front instead of to the people. I had to start breaking trade laws, and now here I am."

"I've heard theres a resistance forming in Orreton. I'm going there. I'm done working with the Empire"

"If I were you... I'd get out of here too"
