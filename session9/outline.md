The loud bang has awakened a treasure crab (too tough to kill)

They enter the treasure room and get the speech from Storm

Timed puzzles to escape from each room. THey are being chased by storm

Escape puzzles:

* Have to draw unlock rune backwards on door.
    after first try, the drawing "panel" turns to glass
* 4 handprints on wall, have to mash them all
* "show me your power". Have to deal 1 lightning damage to the door (or 50 regular damage) (all rolls with advantage)
* Floor is gone, revealing pit beneath
    can find a way across, or can escape by way of the pit

After escaping, they choose a path to leave the cave

Hear the smugglers arguing, Moral choice to save them?

Reynaud is outside of the cave. It's raining hard. He's gathered the dead bodies and is working on building a funeral pyre-boat. Among the wreackage is a broken barrel of distilled storm. Energy is floating upward out of the dust and into the sky.

Reynaud "We made a bad bet... We never should have gotten involved with those cultists, or the Empire."

"I had an honest life before the Empire came. All of the trade goes to the war front instead of to the people. I had to start breaking trade laws, and now here I am."

"I've heard theres a resistance forming in Orreton. I'm going there. I'm done working with the Empire"

"If I were you... I'd get out of here too"

## leaving the cave

You here a voice in your head that you recognize as Morelian's. "We found an abandoned farmhouse to set up in. Meet us here when you can, but only move at night, and cover your faces." and he says an address in The farmland area of Roorsven

## Meeting at the barn

Torshuul and Morelian have set up a makeshift base inside the derelict barn. There is an array of arcane instruments around the edge of the barn, with various implements pointing out of the windows and making quiet, inscrutable noises. Torshuul has a camp area set up with several sleeping pallets. He is standing by a table, working on butchering a deer.

Torshuul: They are looking for you in the city. They seem to have figured out you were here several days ago. They are watching the Crossroads Inn very closely, but they didn't follow you North.

Something changed yesterday, and now the Storm power seems focused in the North sea.

The weather is starting to get worse
