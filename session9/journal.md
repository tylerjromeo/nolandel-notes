Last session we:

* Awakened the huge giant crab, which proceeded to wreck the sahuagins
* Used the Dark Moon unlock symbol to open the door to the treasure rooms
* Found 5 magic scrolls and a fancy gold ring on a pickled hand
* Found an Avatar of Storm in the back store room, who spoke to Bandor and gifted him with the Storm Bodhran, and Instrument of the Bard
* Bandor was tested by the Storm, which chased the party out of the cave
* 4 of the smugglers survived the cave. Things were very tense and they went away to the north.
* Hard rain began to fall outside of the cave
* Got a message from Morelian explaining where he and Torshuul are posted
* Made plans to head back towards Roorsven by land, traveling by night
