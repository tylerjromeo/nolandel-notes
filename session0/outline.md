### Introductions

### What I'm going for

Light-hearted, fun game we can use to be creative and get some human-time while we're all cooped up.

Character and narrative focused. (as opposed to min-max and "winning" focus, or sandbox focus)

Characters have agency in moving the story forward. I am happy to throw away pages and pages of material if somebody does something awesome in-game or goes in an unexpected direction.

If there is a conflict between player characters, try to resolve it narratively as opposed to PvP combat. Avoid rolling dice against other players if you can.

Each session should be like an episode of a TV show. Self contained mini-story, some kind of action or drama, and some advancement on the plot

"fantasy" setting with tropes in full effect


### questions
Have you played Dnd before?

How long are you able to play? How often?

Regular time?

Do we play if someone is missing?

Are there any topics/themes you do not want in the game? (you can let me know offline)

### house rules

The world we're playing in has a lot of blank space, we'll fill it in together

I'll keep track of experience points, you keep track of gold/items.

I'll roll your perception/insight checks for you. Because if you roll badly on picking up information, your character wouldn't know they are missing something
