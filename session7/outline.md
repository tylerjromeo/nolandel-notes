As you proceed through the woods you draw closer to your destination. The trees are less and less dense and you begin to head the sound of running water as you walk along the river Roor.

As you're moving, Bandor you feel *something*. Like a lurch in your brain, something is telling you the right place is very close. You still walking along some cliffs beside the river, but the river has started to widen as it approaches the North sea. It is hard to see accross to the other side of the river. On your side of the bank, down the cliff, you see a small boat on the river bank about 50 feet down. There are fresh tracks in the silt from where someone has dragged the boat on shore.
