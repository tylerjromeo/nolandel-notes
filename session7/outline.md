# Flashback

A 17 year old Bandor Is walking along the seaside market in Porthollow. With him are his 2 best friends. Noah Jerrow, and Hartman DeLionel. What stupid, teenager nonsense are you 3 talking about?

As you talk and laugh, a man walks full into your group, and you all fall down.

"What is the meaning of this, watch where you are going to Gods Forsaken Urchins!" He screams as he picks himself up, and brushes dust off of his fine velvet doublet. "I should have you all arrested"

Reginald Lorenz DeSantos.

He huffs and turns away, stalking off up the docks towards his ship. A brand-new top of the line 3-crew Cutter ship With a name inlayed in silver on the side "The Siren's Song"

# Present day
As you proceed through the woods you draw closer to your destination. The trees are less and less dense and you begin to head the sound of running water as you walk along the river Roor.

As you're moving, Bandor you feel *something*. Like a lurch in your brain, something is telling you the right place is very close. You still walking along some cliffs beside the river, but the river has started to widen as it approaches the North sea. It is hard to see accross to the other side of the river. On your side of the bank, down the cliff, you see a small boat on the river bank about 50 feet down. There are fresh tracks in the silt from where someone has dragged the boat on shore.
