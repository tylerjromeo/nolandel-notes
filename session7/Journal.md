Last session we:

* found a large cave which Bandor had a gut feeling about
* avoided the monster at the entrance
* used stealth powers to sneak around the smuggler's camp finding
* took a pouch of gold, some small treasures, and a vicious dagger from the smuggler's camp. The vicious Dagger was the same one The Gardener tried to sell Henry several days ago.
* traveled up the waterway in the cave and were seen by a lookout. After killing the lookout, you found he was Dark Moon. Took his magic longbow
* Found an area deep in the cave with a pit. At the bottom of that pit was a +1 3-part staff
* Took a short rest in the secluded area of the cave.
