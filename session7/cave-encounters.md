In the furthest room back is the cache of distilled storm. A storm avatar is sitting in here. It's speaking primoridal, a language you didn't know you understood until now.

"The great storm gathers in the North Sea. Soon she will crash and rumble above all and refresh the stagnant water of the land"

"Champion of the Storm, you must be tested before you can be allowed to approach the storm. The whirlpool shall reveal if you are worthy of the Storm's fury."

The avatar disappears, and the glow of the distilled storm fades. But you notice something buried in the dust.

Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement by a bard)

An instrument ofthe bards is an exquisite example of it kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. The following table lists the spells common to all instruments, as well as the spells specific to each one and its rarity. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it canâ€™t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

When you use the instrument to cast a spell that causes targets to become charmed on a failed save, the targets have disadvantage on the saving throw. This effect applies whether you are using the instrument as the source of the spell or as a spellcasting focus.

Spells:
* Fly
* Invisibility
* Levitate
* Protection from good and evil
* Chromatic orb (level 3, only lightning or thunder damage)
* Call lightning
* Beacon of Hope
