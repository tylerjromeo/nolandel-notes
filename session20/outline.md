# Hang glide into town

fight 2x chimera in the air

rules are if you move less than 20 feet you go down a level. You have advantage when attacking something 1 level below you. Can move down at will if you want.

# choice

Dense canopy of the forest. The trees have broad leaves and are a pale green. It doesn't look as lush as you remember it.

large, rectabgle patterns on the ground to the east of the forest. Someone has set up farmland, which is not something you remember.

You see the mountain where you and Nalen lived for many years. You could find your way to the cabin if you wanted to.

(perception check) To the north of the mountain, you see a path. It's hard to tel lfrom this height, but you think there is movement on the path, as if there are a lot of people on it.
