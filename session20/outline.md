# intro

Duur-Ima, you are sitting, eyes closed in front of a dying fire, focused on the ki flowing from the center of your body, to the tips if your fingers, and down into the earth below your simple mountain cabin.

At the edge of your conciousness, you hear the front door creak and the light footfalls of your mentor, Nalen walking in. She has returned from scouting the village to the northwest.

No dark moon. They are just... people.

# Hang glide into town

fight 2x chimera in the air

rules are if you move less than 20 feet you go down a level. You have advantage when attacking something 1 level below you. Can move down at will if you want.


Arrakokra leader from a couple of months ago is there. Zulf.



overhead view of the "playground"

# choice

Dense canopy of the forest. The trees have broad leaves and are a pale green. It doesn't look as lush as you remember it.

large, rectabgle patterns on the ground to the east of the forest. Someone has set up farmland, which is not something you remember.

You see the mountain where you and Nalen lived for many years. You could find your way to the cabin if you wanted to.

(perception check) To the north of the mountain, you see a path. It's hard to tel lfrom this height, but you think there is movement on the path, as if there are a lot of people on it.


# forest

platforms in high trees, with broad ladders in each.

The place appears grown, not built.

Elves around, they are suspicious of the non-humans. Some of them know Duur-Ima

There is commerce here, mostly art.

The *people* look sickly, but they are hiding it.
