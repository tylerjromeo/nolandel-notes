Last session we:

* Went to "The Royal by the River" and bought information from the bartender
* Heard some Rumors about Hammerfast while taking the gradn elevator to Lowtown
* Duur-Ima went to visit the local Dark Moon chapter, and was asked to do a grisly task...
* Henry and Drang played a knife throwing game with some barbarians, and hustled them.
* Bandor found out the barbarian's magic knife came from Yaldobath, but he's been taken in by the Imperials
* Henry met with "The Gardener" a competitor to Yaldobath, and learned that Yaldobath has been taken to "The Hole" a prison in Undertown
* In explaining what she saw at Dark Moon, Duur-Ima sketches a blueprint, which Bandor realizes is a portable magic field generator of some sort
* Met a potion seller who charmed Drang, and identified the party's 2 common potions of healing
* Watched outside the front door of "The Hole" as guards complained about having to work that knight
* "It's always dark in Undertown" "No one sings show tunes in Undertown" "Everyone swears in Undertown"
* Henry met a contact back in lowtown at The Flagon, who advised them to rescue Yaldobath en route, as they will be transferred to Imperial Territory tonight. This information cost 40g


For next session: make a plan of attack in discord. Fell free to OOC talk or use the in-character channel. You have a few hours free in town if you want to prep anything.

Need to make up EXP for all that!
