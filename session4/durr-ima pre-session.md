You find yourself alone in Undertown, the dark slum beneath the overhanging cliff of Roorsven.

You have followed the secret markers and know this building to be the meeting place for The Order of Dark Moon. It appears to be a rotten wooden shack, abandoned and empty.

The door appears wooden with sever broken slats, but it is quite heavy when you pull it open. Inside, there are no torches or candles. With your dark vision you see three figures, 2 seated and one standing, looking over something on a desk between them. They are all clothed in black robes, their hoods drawn over their heads, as is traditional for Disciples of Shar.
