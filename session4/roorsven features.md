### Hightown

two guard wearing Imperial uniforms start to either side of the open portcullis into Hightown. There is a light crowd around the gate, preparing to enter the city.

Past the gate, Hightown Roorsven is a well-kept, clean city. Salesmen call tastefully at you from open storefronts, and you feel a light bump at your back as some children rush by you, laughing.

Men and women move about proudly displaying the crest of Emperor Esmer, and his flag flies above many of the doors


### Lowtown

Lowtown Roorsven is a flurry of activity. The cobbled roads are busy with people travelling both ways, laden carts, and all manner of livestock. Up ahead, you see a man as set up a small booth by the road, and is entertaining children by casting minor spells to make fireworks displays. A small box in front of him contains a few silver coins.

Many of the structures you pass have flyers nailed to them, proclaiming the various triumps of the Empire, and programs to improve life in Roorsven.

#### Residential area

The roads here folow the gentle hills of the land beneath. Houses have been build where they may, and the roads have formed under the footfalls of people moving in between. The houses are well built, but plain. You can see people moving about their business in their homes, or simply chatting with others on the front porch.

#### farms

As you move into farmland, the frequent houses give way to open fields. There is a windmill in the distance, it's blades slowly turning in the soft breeze. The smell of grain and fertilizer dances lightly on the air.

#### Market square

Market square is a cacophony of voices, with barkers yelling at every person they can see who might purchase their wares. It is impossible to move without pushing past other people, as crowds gather at the booths, attempting to haggle over the noise. The goods available are mostly metal tools, fresh vegetables, plain cloth, or other necessities. Although there are a few merchants selling jewelry, wine, and other finery.

### Undertown

It is always dark in undertown; the cliffs of hightown above keep it shaded from the sun most days. There are a few gas lamps here and there, but mostly you see folks moving along in the darkness. Dark elves and Dwarves have no need of light to see in the dark.

The buildings are in poor repair here, you hear the sound of someone coughing loudly in a nearby allyway.
