# In the inn

It's morning, and you 4 are the only guests in the common room of the inn. The innkeep has prepared some fried bread and bacon for the group, as well as cups of very strong tea. "Anything else for you lot?" He says.

"Excellent playing before, Mr. Stormwind. Glad you could come out here"

# Blade headquarters

When you return, people are moving around very quickly. Dispite the late hour, there's a lot of activity and nervous energy. You see JoJo among those moving around, she's carrying a large scak of magic scrolls and yelling something at a group of elves. Blood is dripping from a nasty cut above her eyebrow.

She catches your eye and shouts "Morelian wants to see you! H'es been up all night doing something in his lab. Whatever you sent him sure has got him worked up. Tell him to come outside and help us when he's done fucking around with his toys"

You return to Morelian's lab. Behind him the element pendulum in swinging erratically.

"The power you have when fighting these Dark elementals. It's something innate to each of you that allows you to affect the Dark elemental planes. A projection of sorts that you each have onto that plane. Like how ghosts can touch other ghosts, you four can touch the essence of a dark elemental in a way no other material being can"

"The fact that the four of you just met, and immediately encounter a Prime Dark Elemental is wildly improbable and extremely suspicious. But it is a blessing that we found you."

"I think we need your help to fight these things, and I think it's time we offer you four membership in Blade."

"I've nearly finished designing a new ritual. Go tell Torshuul that you're in, and he'll get you set up with the emblem. You're also free to purchase from our quartermaster now."

"Also uh.. be nice to JoJo today. She's responsibly for keeping Decay contained and well... You know what happened in Hammerfast."

# Artificer and Quartermaster Halvael the Meticulous

Clean-cut, very fancy elf. Big words. Very fussy.

1000g each signing bonus.

"Now these patches are quite special indeed. They'll only show these symbols when you're outside of the material plane. Down there it will be invisible, or show a flower, or anything you'd like. I do like a nice flower pattern on mine with the right outfit."

I've got a few things, my stock varies as the blade folks bring things in and out. Expect to see new things regularly. I always keep the basics stocked of course.

# Ritual puzzle:

each player + morelian + torshuul, need to arrange the 4 of them around a symbol. Morelian has a machine that summons a thrill-seeker magmin

Bandor is taught the "Elemental Banishment" spell. Level 1 spell. Can only target Elementals. Same effect as Banishment.

When in position and casting the spell, get feedback from an instrument, how many people in the right spot, how many people in the wrong spot.

Answer:

-B-
R0I
-H-

# Next day

Morelian's Pendulum swings quietly over the map, tracing a regular pattern over nolandel. As it swings, it begins to speed up. It's movements grow more and more irregular. It traces line after line near the River Roor. With a loud crack of thunder, the pendulm snaps, spilling ink all over the North sea. The ink flows into a shape.

Something's going on North of Roorsven, and we need to find out.

Morelian and Toorshuul are coming with

# In Roorsven

"Mister Stormwind, a word if you please"

"Some Imperials dropped this off this morning"

He shows you a poster that reads: "Wanted for: inciting a riot, resisting arrest, assault of an Imperial officer, and murder. Last seen in Orreton"

And on the poster are sketches of Orrin Cragjaw, Boyland the Miner, and the four of you.

Morelian: "According to my readings... The surge is to the north, near where the River meets the ocean. There's likely to be a lot of caves around there. We should ask around to find a boat, and figure out what it's like up there"

# At smuggler's cave
