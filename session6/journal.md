Last session we:

* Returned to Blade HQ to talk to Morelian
* Learned from Morelian that you each have an innate attunement to the dark elements. He could not, however, explain the strange power surges you experienced the day before
* Got 1000g each as a blade signing bonus. Met Halvael the Meticulous, Quartermaster of Blade, and got Blade patches
* Figured out the correct positioning to perform the permanent banishment ritual
* Returned to The Crossroads Inn to investigate some Storm energy nearby. The Innkeeper was friendly enough with Bandor to warn the group about wanted posters going up around town
* Morelian and Torshuul went into town to learn more, while the party headed north towards the energy
* Climbed a cliff to continue north, and fought some mountain lions in the woods

Next session: we arrive at the site of the Mysterious Storm Energy
