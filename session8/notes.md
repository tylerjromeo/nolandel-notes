Elemental monologue.

Bandor of the Storm's Wind. We welcome you with great Thunder and a brightening flash. It is a great boon to have someone so talented to be gifted The Potential. Take this gift from Storm and come to the chamber with the hurricane that you might be... Tested and Tempered.



Bandor, prove your rumbling strength and bright ambition to me, the Avatar of the Storm. Show me you are worthy of the power.
