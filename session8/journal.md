Last session we:

* Crossed the stepstone pillars and Duur-Ima got 8 mysterious orbs
* Found a note on the lookout's body that had a mysterious symbol
* Killed a pair of Ankhegs that had dug tunnels in the cave
* Killed an Ochre jelly and Drang claimed a broken sword that was inside it.
* Encountered Pyrus the Azer (fire elemental) in the cave that was guarding the smuggler's gold stash. The party learned they could all speak the Primordial language, and struck a deal with Pyrus mto send him back to the Plane of Fire
* Met 3 Bullywugs who were plotting to steal tresure from the Sahuagin tribe, killed 2 stealthily and then knocked out the 3rd.
* Started a fight with the sahuagin tribe and managed to get to dry land
* landed a powerful Thunder Wave on a Sahuagin Priestess, and the sound echoed through the cave's passageways...
