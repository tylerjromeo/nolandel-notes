Decay arc
- why is the decay increasing
    - mayor is corrupt. Is that something?
    - JoJo says teh decay is getting worse, and spreading beyond "the sinkhole" and morelian can't figure out why.
    - reason is that the "abhava" of the forest has been buried in the catacombs under Hammerfast, fueling it's negative energy
    - You cannot approach the Abhava without dying. Standing 20 feet away ages you double. 5 feet away is 1 year/hour. touching it is 100 years in a minute. The Ayus can counter this effect.
    - Mayor Jens Hanotar has been kidnapped and replaced with an agent of Ruin. This agent paid Shining skull to raid the forest and steal the Ayus and the Abhava.
    - Jens is trapped in his own Manse, but still able to send correspondence. He has been willfully misapprpriating funds in the hope that someone will investigate it. "They watch my correspondence closely, I had to be suspicious to someone on the outside, but not alert my captors"
- Shining skull has 
    - They stole the "ayus" and the "abhava" from the forest
    - They still have the Ayus, because holding it makes you stronger, as it gives you life energy temporarily
    - Zaar, Sturm's advisor, has orchestrated all this. He is a Jafar/Gul'dan type figure.
- must participate in a tournament
    - cheating is expected, but it is dishonorable to be caught cheating. It is also dishonorable to accuse somone else of cheating, because a strong warrior can even an unfair fight.
    - Sturm is going to over-partake in the power of the Ayus and become a huge, over-vigorous, blood beast
- must take mcguffin into woods
