* traveling and see some carnage from a Shining Skull raid
* fight against battlefield scavengers (ash devils? Blood gels?)
    ghouls + ghasts
* Introduction to Hammerfast
* JoJo is focused on relief, but the decay keeps increasing and we can't figure out why. Magical detection wont work so we need good ol detective work 
* Or maybe JoJo finds somethign out but then gets taken (damsel in distress trope is rough though)


# The carnage
## pre fight
Drang, you're 6 years old, standing next to your father, Sturm. You're on top of a small hill, overlooking the warriors of your tribe looting the village of Karhold. Most of Karhold's residents lie dead or bleeding on the ground. "Breathe in, son" Sturm says. The metallic, slightly sweet tang of blood and death fills your nose. "That's the smell of victory."

And it's what you smell right now, with your 4 friends standing with you. You can see the tops of the tallest buildings in hammerfast poking just above the horizon in the last light of the setting sun as you crest a hill.

Those of you with Darkvision see in tones of gray, dozens of bodies layed out in the road and off to the sides in the ditches and around the fields. THere is still enough twilight remaining for those of you without darkvision to see red, bloody footprints crisscrossing in every direction. The bodies are all positioned awkwardly and some in piles, any weapons or valuables seem to have been taken.

Looking around, you realize that there is movement among the dead.

Somone is hunched over one of the bodies. You hear a snapping sound like wet meat being torn apart. It's pale gray face turns towards you. The creature has one grey eye, limp hair and rows of long, pointed teeth. Blood and half-chewed flesh spatter out of it's mouth as it shrieks and runs towards you.

## post fight
Laying on the ground near a particularly large pile of bodies is a banner. An orange field with a red sunburst design surrounding a black skull. (poke drang)

## Hammerfast

Hammerfast city ios a very large city, walled on 3 sides, and with the sea on the fourth. tall cathedrals and opulent manses poke out above the walls. On the northeastern section, you see part of the wall is crumbling and worn down.

JoJo told you to meet her at Ol' Sammy's place, which has become the makeshift base camp for relief efforts in The Sinkhole.

Drang, as you approach the threshold of Hammerfast's walls, a feeling of dread overcomes you. Not the exhilerating fear of a powerful opponent, but an existensial terror, screaming out that you should not take one more step into this place.

As you hesitate, your hand touches the hilt of you broken longsword and you feel a wamrth spreading from it.

DC 15 Wisdom save with advantage or else you cannot walk over the threshold willingly.

## The Sinkhole

The Sinkhole is a grim place. The large manses in the Gold District and the modest homes of Moradin's Bellow alike have rotted and collapsed on themselves. You see people working on repairing the buildings that still stand. You pass a pair of humans putting a freshly painted sign for "Crazy Eddie and Hoppin' Harry's Oysters and Clams" at a newly build stand holding a trough of ice. The air is humid and you are surrounded by an earthy, compost smell.

As you approach Ol' Sammy's. You see JoJo outside, talking with a richly dressed human woman (Sheara Bernhardt) and a Dwarf man with auburn hair and a wide brimmed hat (Crag Umber). Sitting at a table nearby is a tall, uncannily beautiful woman with long golden hair and pupil-less silver eyes. (Valtaria the Blessed)

As you leave, you can see the sign for "Crazy Eddie's and Hoppin' Harry's Oysters and Clams". The paint is already peeling and chipped, and the wooden posts are wet and rotten.


## Leads

JoJo is working on organizing construction, relocating people who have lost homes, and setting up food shelters outside of the sinkhole, as food rots quickly inside.

Sheara is a gossip, and she will talk about how much the mayor is spending, and how the Empire is sending him money for Sinkhole relief but they never see any of it. It's up to The Nolandel Protectorate Society to actually raise the funds. Will gossip about how he's been meeting with thieves are barbarians on the side but he didn't even show up at the social fundraiser last week and they had to get all new refreshments because of the marshmallow ban.

Crag is concerned about marauders getting in through the weakened wall, because they've been seen around and entering the catacombs. He will reveal it's Shining Skull if he trusts them. He's been dealing with a lot of folks trying to blame "sinkhole dwellers" for crime because there's a rumor that they were punished for sin/demon worship. Cheif councilor Armonde Jabraxi is vehemently denying it, which doesn't help because everyone knows he's a demon worshiper. Mayor Hanotar won't give a public comment, which also makes it worse.

Valtaria wants to help with warding the area around the Sinkhole, but the only place to get the reagents she needs is from Ushad, and trade is illegal. She has been working with the Catacombs crew to smuggle some things in, but it is not enough. She's been tracking the sinkhole's rate of spread and it's nearly doubled in comparison to the week before. Additionally, the Moradin's wood had been spreading much slower, but now it was getting worse.

They might also meet Gelfin "Shitmouth" the halfling. He's been trying to find Orelle Underground (wood elf) who leads the catacombs crew, but he can't find him. Shitmouth ran lookout for him a week ago on a meeting in the Capitol district. Orelle's been missing 5 days. There are sections of the catacombs they don't go in anymore.

## Hooks:

The catacombs: search for Orelle. Find the Abhava?

The Mayor: try to meet with/infiltrate the Mayor's manse. Learn about the switcheroo

The woods: discover that the heart of the forest has been stolen and split.
