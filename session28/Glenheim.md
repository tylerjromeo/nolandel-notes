# The Mangrove

From far away, it appears to be a small grassy park. Moving closer, you see trees covered in moss with long, willowy branches hanging down. The ground beneath your feet grows wet and muddy as you proceed, and the sound of voices and machinery starts to fade.

You would have expected to emerge from the other side of the park by now, but you haven't. The mangrove goes deeper, and there is an inch of water pooling around your boots.
