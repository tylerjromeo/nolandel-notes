# flashback

Henry + Harold in Tangrell pulling a job.

Some light banter

"Okay Henry; Fuck, Marry, Kill: The Enchantress Duessa, Empress Oriana Esmer, or Guild Leader Priya?

"you're up, Henry" as Harold ducks into an ally

Henry distracts the guards, and they get in

# Intro

You approach the machine city of Glenham. The city is surronded by a metalworked wall, in the shape of a gear with 12 teeth. There are many tall building inside the city, many with mechanically moving parts. The talled tower has large metal spikes sitcking fro the top, around which there are plumes of smoke. As you pass through the large archway into the city you can see that the inside is detailed with intricate patterns, and masterfully crafted. You feel the pressing of peopl at your sides as they all move about their business. There are a great many halflings, making it easy for your group to see above the crowd, but hard to blend in.

You can see a few people standing near an obelisk on the side of the street. They are asking it questions about the city, and it answers them in a clear voice.

# kiosk

## the living borough

The living borough is where most of the citizens of Glenham make their homes. It is also home to inns, grocers, clothiers, and anything else you might need!

## The quiet spring

I recommend the quiet spring. A cozy, homey little inn right on the border of the historic crafter's borough! Be sure to ask about their famous spiced rum roast.

# living borough

## the quiet spring

Very crowded

## Pegleg Pete's

Less crowded

## People in inn

thieves guild: Anya and Talia

dragonborn tourists: Kraal and Yoortun

Innkeep: Pegleg Pete or Udina Cromwell

Papercraft master: Jiin

# Military Borough

Harold of Tangrell looks like a younger, taller version of Henry. He's wearing a set of ornate armor and his hand reads on the pommel his sword.

# Crafter's Borough

Guild steward Pardak Wrynn

A sharp eyed, very old halfling. His left eye appears huge through the jeweler's loupe he's using.

Wants the empire gone because they have non-union folks in the research tower

# Research Borough

You see a lot more humans here than you do in the rest of the city, and a lot more imperial heraldry as well. The research tower looms over you, and there are odd patches of shade, as the smoke obscures the view of the sky above.

* the magical energy around teh tower is extremely out of whack

* There are a lot of humans, halflings, and steelkin entering and exiting, and they seem to be following some sort of process

* There are 2 imperials at the door with smoke weapons. And at least 4 patrolling around, and 10 hidden in vantage points.

# Steel Borough

Dark, many warforged

"Razor" can speak "Flesh languages"

Does not like how steelkin are treated.

Those who work in the research tower are "changed" and become loyal.

# The Mangrove

From far away, it appears to be a small grassy park. Moving closer, you see trees covered in moss with long, willowy branches hanging down. The ground beneath your feet grows wet and muddy as you proceed, and the sound of voices and machinery starts to fade.

You would have expected to emerge from the other side of the park by now, but you haven't. The mangrove goes deeper, and there is an inch of water pooling around your boots.

* The Mangrove Keeper, Wind-Through-The-Reeds

Half orc wearing vines leaves and sections of bark. He has symbols on his face indicating the four elements.

The mangroves energies are essential tooperating the kiosk network and the research tower.

WTTR has felt the imbalance towards smoke, and can show it to Kiri

# Blade

JoJo is with them, Morelian sends her a message that Blade hq has been abandoned. He has met up with Yaldobath and they will be in Glenham in a day's time.

# Guild

Either by directly reaching out to underground, or because they are observed skulking, the guild will become aware of them

# The heist crew

want to steel the platinum core from the arcane matrix (source of smoke)

Whetstone - halfling high up in the guild. She's in charge. Play it like renegade shepard
Beartrap - Dwarf metalsmith. Just got replaced by a non-union guy, wants revenge and brough the job
Piper - Harold. In charge of moving the platinum with his network of corrupt guardsmen
Sparks - Halfling wizard. Has developed a new spell to decrease the weight of an object 100 fold for an hour

They need the party because the Empire is watching known guild associates.

Need:
- a way in
- how to get through:
- "organic weaponry division" Monster stable
- "advanced training facility" enhanced humans (vivsected warforged?)
- "extraplanar medical treatment facility" Necromancy stuff
- "automated production" Conveyor belt puzzle
- guards around arcane matrix
- a way out
