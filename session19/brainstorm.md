Big giant making a sandcastle with real people inside

Volleyball game.

Goblins stole the roast pig.

# Intro

You've been back at B.L.A.D.E. Hq for several days. You've been congratulated and commended by any and everyone. The is a general air of excitement all around the base. With Storm, the number of incidents decreased dramatically after your group banished it, and the same seems to be holding true for decay.

The decision remains then, where to go nex to seek a concentration or the Dark Elements. Kiri's prophecy seem to be pointing to an imperial military research facility, or somewhere in the mountains overlooking a village.

Torshuul, Lamruil, and Morelian are in council

# Notes

Imperials are producing weapons at a worrying rate (Lamruil's concern abotu this might betray his loyalties)

Kourian Gave's and the PSI are not far from the town of Emmnor, (where Duur-Ima is from). Rumors say they have gone rogue, interrogating and torturing those in their path. Another rumor says their leader is a demon.

# Interruption!

Suddenly an image appears on the table in front of you. It's your friend Bodhi the beach dwarf, and his eyes are filled with fear. You can see his mouth moving and he looks at each of you, but you can't hear him. He panics for a moment, then reaches down towards his feet. He scratches for a moment, then you see him holding a piece of driftwood with 4 words on it "NORTH SEA. COME NOW". He drops the wood and runs out of frame, and the image dissapears.

# Getting there

You're all anchored at Hammerfast, about as far from the north sea as you can get. There is a spell I can use to break that anchor and send you anywhere on the material plane... But it's expensive.

# On the beach

Thank the Surf you're all here. Something terrible is about to happen.

A gang of Elves are trying to move in on our beach.

If we lose the volleyball game, those Elves will basically *own* the beach all year. Our best players went to practice at the beach and they are gone!

# Drunken giant has the dwarves in his sandcastle.

Giant is eating whole coconut drinks by the handful.

fight? talk their way out? Who knows?

# Vollyball game

You see the opposing team, 8 tall, lean tan elves in matching swimsuits.

# After victory

"Hmph! You may have won this round... But we'll be back next year!"
