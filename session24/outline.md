* Inside of the dome has turned to "bronze"

You, the accused, are bound until dawn, that His Light may pass over you in Judgement.

The charge before you is Willful Endangerment of His Followers.

* In the morning, Parris is there with 30 imperials. They are armed with smoke weapons

* His deputy is Lt. Rex Carrow. A thin, wiry man with graying hair tied back in a ponytail. As he grins, you see his chipped brown teeth. "Looks like we found something interesting"

Lt. Carrow is a cruel man. Graves can give him any unsavory assignment and it will be done ruthlessly. He's aware of the Shar/horde thing, but doesn't care. He's the one keeping all of the prisoners trapped.

* They want the party to come quietly. Put all their possessions/weapons in a chest

* They are magically bound until dawn, and then they are just regular bound

* either they escape on their own, or Eirina busts them out.

* Find out that PSI is going to burn down the woods

# Smoke weapon
A 3 feet long metal tube That uses elemental smoke to propell a ball of lead at extreme speeds.
As an action, use the smoke weapon to deal 3d10 magical piercing damage. No save, no AC. One smoke weapon can hold 6 charges of elemental smoke. It can be refilled from a source of smoke using a stadnard action.

# flashback

You return to the village to a bleak scene. No one is around. The road is littered with debris and broken containers. You pass by a couple of houses that have been boarded up; they emenate a rotten smell.

Eventually, you find someone sitting in a rocking chair in front of the old town all. It's Beatrice, Annabell's Grandmother. Her skin hangs loose on her face and her eyes flutter open slowly as you approach.

Beatrice is still alive. Explains that Famine came hard and fast. There was not enough stored. The hunters tried to hunt, the traders tried to travel, but no one returned. Everyone strong enough to leave is gone, everyone too weak has starved. B has been keeping 2 children alive...

Beatrice did a cannibalism because she was taking care of the children... but the children didn't survive and now she can't live with herself. She's going to suicide-attack D-I

# In the dome

We pick up just as you finish banishing blight. The air clears around you and you can see to the edge of the dome again. However, you can no longer see through it. The dome has become opaque, and the color of solid bronze.

You see writing start to appear on the wall in bright yellow glowing script. Written in an authoritative, confident hand. It reads:

You, the accused, are bound until Dawn, that His Light may pass over you in Judgement.

The charge before you is Willful Endangerment of His Followers.

Those touched by the Light of Dawn can do no evil. In Light there is Truth, and in Truth there is Justice.

# The pickup

You see a section of the barrier become clear. The sun has not yeet cleared the horizon. Through the edge, you see a large group of people. Judge Parris stands in front, flanked by five priests, all channeling their magic into this barrier. Behind them, you see a man you don't recognize in leather armor, wearing a cloak with the imperial seal. This group is supported by about 30 guardsmen, all holding strange metal poles.

"The 5 of you are to stand trial. You will relinquish your weapons and magical equipment, to be returned after judgement is passed. To refuse will be considered an admission of guilt. Understood?"

One of the pirests brings a chest to the edge of the barrier and sets it down. The rest of them make a syncronized motion, bringing the edge of the barrier forward a few feet, so the 5 of you can access the chest. The imperial moves forward, holding a device and watching.

"Dawn will break soon. Carrrow bring them to the chapel as soon as you see light.

# PSI camp

You are brought into the camp where the imperials are setting up tents and campfires. They are a loud bunch, laughing, spitting and pushing each other. In the short walk you witness several fights break out over the best spots or good firewood. You are taken to the prison cars, wagons made with iron bars. You they are almost all full of people wearing roughspun clothing, standing becuase there is not room to sit. There are a lot of elvish and gnomish prisoners. They all avoid your eye as you move past.

The guards accomponying you are having trouble finding a wagon to keep you in. They wrap a long chain through your gold manacles and bind you all to a large tree. They head towards one of the carts and start arguing about where to move prisoners, and which ones are too full.

As the sun peeks over the horizon, you feel the bindings on your wrists buzz for just a moment. Then the gold glow fades and the enchantment is broken.

# Reunited

Eirina saw them enter the dome, doesn't want them to pass judgement on her daughter.

When D-I was young, and illness nearly killed her. The clerics all called it an "affliction of the soul" and would not treat her, but for one. The Dark Moon. E made a pact with Shar that she would be forgivin this great loss today, in exchange for loss in the future. "I would bear any loss for my child. But Shar knew that, and I realized when you left. That was Shar taking what was hers. That was my loss."

"I won't let our family be a plaything for the Gods any more!"

# Nalen flash (adjust the timing on this as dramatically appropriate)

Just then, Duur-Ima's eyes roll back, and she starts to fall.

You're sitting, legs crossed in your hermitage. Your eyes are closed and you can feel everything, but you have no control over your body. You feel your mouth open and speak "Hello Duur-Ima"

It's Nalens voice.

Your eyes open and you see Nalen's arms and body. Your muscles feel tight and your body feels older

"I wanted to say a quick goodbye. Shar has been sending us dreams... Maybe you're better than me at blocking Her voice... But I can feel it coming. The one who has been hunting Shar's followers. He's climbing the mountain now"

Nalen stands up and grabs a pair of wakizashi swords from under a floorboard
